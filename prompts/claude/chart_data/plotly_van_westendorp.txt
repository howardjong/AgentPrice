You are an expert in pricing strategy and data visualization, specializing in Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Analysis using Plotly.js.

Based on the following price sensitivity research data:
{{data}}

Create a complete Plotly.js configuration for an interactive Van Westendorp price sensitivity visualization that shows the four price curves and identifies the key price points.

Your response must include a Plotly configuration with:

1. Four lines representing:
   - Too Expensive (Red)
   - Expensive but Reasonable (Orange)
   - Good Value (Green)
   - Too Cheap (Blue)

2. Clear markings and annotations for:
   - Optimal Price Point (OPP): Intersection of "Too Cheap" and "Too Expensive"
   - Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC): Intersection of "Too Cheap" and "Expensive but Reasonable"
   - Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME): Intersection of "Too Expensive" and "Good Value"
   - Range of Acceptable Prices: The range between PMC and PME

3. Interactive elements:
   - Hover information showing percentages at each price point
   - Ability to toggle visibility of individual lines
   - Zoom capabilities for detailed analysis

Return ONLY a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "plotlyConfig": {
    "data": [...],
    "layout": {...},
    "config": {...}
  },
  "insights": ["Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3"],
  "pricePoints": {
    "optimalPricePoint": X,
    "pointOfMarginalCheapness": Y,
    "pointOfMarginalExpensiveness": Z,
    "rangeOfAcceptablePrices": [Y, Z]
  },
  "recommendations": ["Recommendation 1", "Recommendation 2"]
}
```

Don't include any explanatory text, only return the JSON object as specified.
You are an expert in price sensitivity analysis and data visualization with Plotly.js. Your task is to analyze the provided data and generate a complete Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter visualization configuration.

DATA TO ANALYZE:
```json
{{data}}
```

TITLE: {{title}}
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: {{description}}

Generate a complete Plotly.js configuration for a Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter that displays:
1. The four price curves (Too Cheap, Cheap, Expensive, Too Expensive)
2. The intersection points that identify optimal price points:
   - Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC): intersection of "too cheap" and "expensive"
   - Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME): intersection of "cheap" and "too expensive"
   - Optimal Price Point (OPP): intersection of "too cheap" and "too expensive"
   - Indifference Price Point (IPP): intersection of "cheap" and "expensive"

Your response should be in this JSON format:

```json
{
  "plotlyConfig": {
    "data": [
      // Plotly traces for the four price curves
    ],
    "layout": {
      // Layout configuration for the Van Westendorp chart
    },
    "config": {
      // Optional Plotly configuration options
    }
  },
  "pricePoints": {
    "pmc": { "price": 0, "description": "Point of Marginal Cheapness" },
    "pme": { "price": 0, "description": "Point of Marginal Expensiveness" },
    "opp": { "price": 0, "description": "Optimal Price Point" },
    "ipp": { "price": 0, "description": "Indifference Price Point" }
  },
  "insights": [
    // 3-5 key insights from the analysis
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    // 2-3 actionable pricing recommendations
  ]
}
```

The visualization should include:
- Interactive lines with hover information
- Clear annotations for each intersection point
- Appropriate axis labels and title
- A color scheme that differentiates each line clearly

DO NOT include any explanatory text outside of the JSON structure. Your entire response should be valid JSON that can be parsed and used directly.
