Generate a Conjoint Analysis visualization using the following data:
{{data}}
{{#if title}}The title should be: {{title}}{{/if}}
{{#if description}}Additional context: {{description}}{{/if}}

For the Conjoint Analysis visualization:
1. Create a horizontal bar chart showing the relative importance or utility scores for each attribute and level
2. Organize by attributes (feature categories) and their levels (specific options)
3. Use consistent color coding for each attribute category
4. Sort attributes by importance (highest impact attributes at the top)
5. Include a clear legend with attribute categories

The visualization should clearly show:
- Which product attributes have the strongest impact on customer preference
- The relative importance of different attribute levels within each attribute category
- The overall importance ranking of attributes

Please provide a visualization in SVG format that best represents this data.
The SVG should be complete and valid, with appropriate dimensions, styling, and responsive design.
Include clear labels, a legend, and ensure all data points are accurately represented.

Return ONLY the SVG code without any additional explanation.

At the very end of your SVG, please include your model name as a comment like this: <!-- model: your-model-name -->
