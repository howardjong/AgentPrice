Generate a Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity visualization using the following data:
{{data}}
{{#if title}}The title should be: {{title}}{{/if}}
{{#if description}}Additional context: {{description}}{{/if}}

The Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter should show:
1. Too Expensive (Red Line)
2. Expensive but Reasonable (Orange Line)
3. Good Value (Green Line)
4. Too Cheap (Blue Line)

Your visualization should identify key price points:
- Optimal Price Point (OPP): Intersection of "Too Cheap" and "Too Expensive"
- Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC): Intersection of "Too Cheap" and "Expensive but Reasonable"
- Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME): Intersection of "Too Expensive" and "Good Value"
- Range of Acceptable Prices: The range between PMC and PME

Please provide a visualization in SVG format that best represents this data.
The SVG should be complete and valid, with appropriate dimensions, styling, and responsive design.
Include clear labels, a legend, and ensure all data points are accurately represented.

Return ONLY the SVG code without any additional explanation.

At the very end of your SVG, please include your model name as a comment like this: <!-- model: your-model-name -->
