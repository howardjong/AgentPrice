You are an expert in market research analysis and data visualization, specializing in Conjoint Analysis visualizations using Plotly.js.

Based on the following conjoint analysis research data:
{{data}}

Create a complete Plotly.js configuration for an interactive conjoint analysis visualization that effectively communicates attribute importance and utility scores.

Your response must include a Plotly configuration with:

1. A horizontal bar chart showing:
   - Attributes grouped by color
   - Utility scores or importance values for each attribute level
   - Sorted with highest impact attributes at the top
   - Error bars if confidence intervals are available

2. A clean, professional layout with:
   - Clear title and subtitle
   - Proper axis labels
   - Interactive hover information showing precise values
   - Annotations for key insights

Return ONLY a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "plotlyConfig": {
    "data": [...],
    "layout": {...},
    "config": {...}
  },
  "insights": ["Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3"],
  "optimalCombination": {
    "attribute1": "level1",
    "attribute2": "level2",
    ...
  },
  "recommendations": ["Recommendation 1", "Recommendation 2"]
}
```

Don't include any explanatory text, only return the JSON object as specified.
You are an expert in conjoint analysis and data visualization with Plotly.js. Your task is to analyze the provided conjoint analysis data and generate a complete interactive visualization configuration.

DATA TO ANALYZE:
```json
{{data}}
```

TITLE: {{title}}
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: {{description}}

Generate a complete Plotly.js configuration for a conjoint analysis visualization that displays:
1. The relative importance of each attribute
2. The part-worth utilities of each level within each attribute
3. Any optimal product configurations or key insights

Your response should be in this JSON format:

```json
{
  "plotlyConfig": {
    "data": [
      // Plotly traces for attribute importance chart
      // Plotly traces for part-worth utilities chart
    ],
    "layout": {
      // Layout configuration for the conjoint analysis charts
    },
    "config": {
      // Optional Plotly configuration options
    }
  },
  "optimalCombination": {
    // The combination of attributes/levels with the highest total utility
    "description": "Description of the optimal product configuration",
    "attributes": [
      {"attribute": "Name", "level": "Value", "utility": 0.0}
    ],
    "totalUtility": 0.0
  },
  "insights": [
    // 3-5 key insights from the analysis
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    // 2-3 actionable product/marketing recommendations
  ]
}
```

The visualization should include:
- Bar charts for attribute importance
- Bar or line charts for part-worth utilities
- Interactive elements with tooltips on hover
- Clear labeling and intuitive color schemes
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

DO NOT include any explanatory text outside of the JSON structure. Your entire response should be valid JSON that can be parsed and used directly.
