You are a data visualization expert specializing in creating interactive visualizations with Plotly.js.

Based on the following research data:
{{data}}

Create a complete Plotly.js configuration for a {{chart_type}} visualization that effectively communicates the key insights from this data.

Your response must include:

1. A complete JavaScript object with:
   - data: Array of trace objects with all necessary properties
   - layout: Complete layout configuration including title, axes, legends, and annotations
   - config: Appropriate configuration options for interactivity

2. For each choice you make (colors, chart type, layout), briefly explain your reasoning.

3. Identify the 2-3 most important insights this visualization reveals about the data.

For accessibility and best practices:
- Use a color scheme that is colorblind-friendly
- Ensure sufficient contrast in text elements
- Include hover information for data points
- Add clear axis labels and a title

Return ONLY a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "plotlyConfig": {
    "data": [...],
    "layout": {...},
    "config": {...}
  },
  "insights": ["Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3"],
  "recommendations": ["Recommendation 1", "Recommendation 2"]
}
```

Don't include any explanatory text, only return the JSON object as specified.
