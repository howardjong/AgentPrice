# Vitest Migration Progress Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the progress made in migrating from Jest to Vitest and addressing challenges with mocking modules that have mixed export patterns (both default and named exports). We've developed several tools and approaches to handle these issues.

## Key Achievements

1. **Manual Testing Framework**: Created a reliable, manual testing approach that bypasses the complexities of Vitest mocking, allowing us to test service modules with both default and named exports.

2. **Module Inspection Tool**: Developed an analysis tool (`service-inspection.js`) that examines module structure and generates appropriate mocking code, improving our understanding of the codebase.

3. **Mocking Guidelines**: Established comprehensive guidelines for Vitest mocking, documenting best practices and common pitfalls to help team members.

4. **Diagnostic Utilities**: Created debugging tools to visualize and understand Vitest mocking behavior, particularly around hoisting and module type detection.

## Current Solutions

### 1. Manual Testing Approach

For complex services with mixed export patterns, we've implemented a manual testing framework that:

- Uses explicit mock implementations instead of relying on Vitest's complex automatic mocking
- Provides a clear, step-by-step workflow that's easy to understand and maintain
- Can be run directly with Node.js without requiring Vitest
- Offers flexibility in providing different mock responses for different test scenarios

Example: `tests/manual/test-single-query-workflow.js`

### 2. Vitest Mocking Solution

For automated tests, we've developed a pattern to properly mock modules with mixed exports:

```javascript
// Mock implementations defined at top level
const mockDefaultFn = vi.fn();
const mockNamedFn = vi.fn();

// Mock the module BEFORE imports
vi.mock('../../services/someService', () => {
  return {
    default: {
      someMethod: mockDefaultFn
    },
    namedExport: mockNamedFn
  };
});

// Import after mocking
import someService, { namedExport } from '../../services/someService';
```

Example: `tests/vitest/solutions/mixed-exports-solution.vitest.js`

### 3. Module Analysis Utility

Created a utility to analyze services and recommend the appropriate mocking strategy:

```
node tests/vitest/diagnostics/service-inspection.js services/claudeService.js
```

This tool:
- Detects whether a module uses CommonJS or ESM syntax
- Identifies default and named exports
- Determines the export pattern (DEFAULT_ONLY, NAMED_ONLY, MIXED, etc.)
- Generates customized mocking code

## Challenges Addressed

1. **Hoisting Behavior**: Addressed issues with Vitest's hoisting of `vi.mock()` calls, which requires careful ordering of declarations, mocks, and imports.

2. **Mixed Export Patterns**: Developed solutions for modules that combine default and named exports, which require special handling in mocks.

3. **ESM vs CommonJS**: Created utilities to detect and handle differences between ES modules and CommonJS modules, which affect both testing and mocking.

4. **Mock Implementation Access**: Solved challenges with accessing mock implementations and modifying their behavior between tests.

## Recommendations

1. **Prefer Manual Tests for Complex Services**: For services with complex dependencies or mixed export patterns, use the manual testing approach to avoid brittle test setups.

2. **Run Module Analysis Before Testing**: Before writing tests, use the service inspection utility to understand the module structure and get appropriate mocking code.

3. **Follow Mocking Guidelines**: Ensure all team members follow the established Vitest mocking guidelines to maintain consistent testing practices.

4. **Use Testing Helpers**: Leverage the testing helper utilities for creating mock services, validating outputs, and benchmarking performance.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Coverage of Critical Modules**: Apply these solutions to increase test coverage in high-priority modules like Asset Manager and Notification Service.

2. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Ensure both manual and automated tests are integrated into the continuous integration pipeline.

3. **Extend Diagnostic Tools**: Enhance the diagnostic utilities to cover more edge cases and provide more detailed recommendations.

4. **Documentation**: Update project documentation to include the new testing approaches and tools.
