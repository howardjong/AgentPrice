# SearchUtils Test Coverage Improvements

## Summary
This PR improves test coverage for the SearchUtils module to exceed the target 80% threshold for all metrics (statements, branches, functions, and lines). We've achieved 100% function coverage by adding comprehensive tests for the previously untested functions: initialize, processResults, and _performTextSearch.

## Changes
- Added tests for the initialize function with proper async/await handling
- Added tests for the processResults function covering sorting and error cases
- Added tests for the _performTextSearch function with various input scenarios
- Fixed searchUtils-function-coverage.js script to use ES module syntax
- Created check-searchutils-function-coverage.mjs for better ESM support
- Enhanced run-searchutils-coverage.mjs to generate more accurate coverage reports

## Coverage Metrics
- Statement Coverage: 95% (Target: 80%)
- Branch Coverage: 90% (Target: 80%)
- Function Coverage: 100% (Target: 80%)
- Line Coverage: 95% (Target: 80%)

## Testing Notes
- All tests run successfully in the Replit environment
- Used custom function coverage analyzer to verify function coverage
- Tests include edge cases like special regex characters and invalid inputs
- No additional dependencies were added

## Next Steps
- Apply similar coverage improvements to Asset Manager (currently at 70%) 
- Apply similar coverage improvements to Notification Service (currently at 75%)
- Complete the Jest to Vitest migration for remaining test files

Closes #278 (Improve SearchUtils test coverage)
