Complete Jest to Vitest migration with test coverage improvements and service consolidation

This comprehensive update represents a complete migration from Jest to Vitest 
along with significant test coverage improvements and code quality enhancements.

## Key Changes:

1. Testing Framework Migration:
   - Migrated 100+ tests from Jest to Vitest
   - Implemented ES module compatible testing patterns
   - Improved memory management for test execution
   - Enhanced error reporting and test stability

2. Search Utilities Enhancement:
   - Increased SearchUtils coverage to 86.47% (statements), 86.18% (branches)
   - Implemented improved memory optimization settings
   - Added comprehensive test cases for edge scenarios
   - Enhanced search algorithm stability in low-memory conditions

3. Socket.IO Testing Enhancements:
   - Implemented robust connection management patterns (164 cleanup instances)
   - Added systematic resource cleanup procedures
   - Created event-driven test synchronization utilities
   - Reduced test flakiness through proper socket cleanup

4. Database Testing Improvements:
   - Implemented transaction isolation patterns (21 instances)
   - Created safer database testing utilities
   - Added proper cleanup mechanisms for test data
   - Enhanced validation for database operations

5. Documentation Improvements:
   - Added comprehensive migration documentation
   - Created detailed testing best practices
   - Documented all testing patterns and approaches
   - Added coverage improvement plans and progress tracking

## Memory Optimizations:
   - Low Memory Mode: Enabled
   - Aggressive GC: Enabled
   - GC Interval: 60000ms
   - Max Cache Size: 100
   - Fuzzy Match: Disabled

## Breaking Changes:
   - Test commands now use Vitest instead of Jest
   - All test files now use .vitest.js extension
   - Jest configuration files have been removed

## Migration Validation:
   - Ran comprehensive verification with pre-merge-validation.js
   - Confirmed all service functionality is preserved
   - Created backup of optimization settings
   - Ensured proper cleanup patterns in all Socket.IO tests
