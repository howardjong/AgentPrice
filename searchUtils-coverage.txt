SearchUtils.js Coverage Summary:
Statements: 86.88%
Branches: 87.82%
Functions: 64.28%
Lines: 86.88%

ENVIRONMENT NOTE: Due to Replit environment constraints, the full test suite cannot be
run at once because of timeout limitations. Tests must be run on a file-by-file basis,
with socket.io tests being particularly problematic due to their complex network simulation.

NOTE: Function coverage for searchUtils.js is still at 64.28%, 
which is below the 80% target coverage. This is because some private helper 
functions are not exported and therefore cannot be directly tested.

We've added tests for the following functions:
- sortResults
- paginateResults 
- normalizeFilters
- applyFilters
- transformResults

The remaining private functions that need further testing:
- calculateRelevanceScore
- highlightMatchingText
- formatDate

To improve function coverage, these private functions can either be:
1. Exported for direct testing
2. Tested indirectly through exported functions that use them
3. Refactored to be more testable

Our private tests have significantly improved line and branch coverage 
(both now above 85%) but function coverage requires further work.
