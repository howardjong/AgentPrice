# Socket.IO Test Optimizations for Replit Environment

## Critical Changes

- Added optimized Socket.IO utilities in `tests/unit/utils/socket-test-optimization.js` to address timeout and stability issues in Replit environment
- Implemented sample optimized reconnection test in `tests/unit/websocket/optimized-reconnect-test.vitest.js`
- Reduced timeouts from 5000ms to 2000ms for critical Socket.IO operations
- Added explicit cleanup of event listeners to prevent memory leaks
- Implemented safe disconnect operations with timeout protection
- Created comprehensive health check utility in `tests/unit/websocket/socket-io-health-check.js` to validate Socket.IO environment
- Created detailed documentation in `docs/socketio-test-optimizations.md` and `docs/socket-io-merge-checklist.md`

## Migration Notes

- All existing Socket.IO tests should be updated to use these optimizations
- Timeouts over 5000ms should be avoided in Socket.IO tests
- The `removeAllListeners()` call is essential during test cleanup
- When running in debug mode, use `DEBUG=socket.io*` environment variable
- Run the health check utility before merging to verify environment compatibility

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: These changes only affect test infrastructure, not production code
- **Positive Impact**: Improves test stability in Replit environment
- **Regression Prevention**: Addresses key issues identified in pre-merge validation report
