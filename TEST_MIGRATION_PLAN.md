# Jest to Vitest Migration and Mocking Improvement Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for migrating our test suite from Jest to Vitest, while enhancing our mocking capabilities for complex testing scenarios, including integration testing and long-running processes.

## Why Migrate to Vitest?

- **âœ… Performance**: Vitest leverages Vite's dev server for significantly faster test execution
- **âœ… ESM Compatibility**: Better support for ES modules without configuration workarounds
- **âœ… Memory Efficiency**: Reduced memory footprint, especially important for our resource-intensive tests
- **âœ… Watch Mode**: Improved watch mode with faster reloads
- **âœ… Similar API**: Vitest has a Jest-compatible API that minimizes code changes

## Migration Goals

1. Complete migration from Jest to Vitest
2. Implement robust mocking for external services
3. Support testing of long-running operations
4. Create a foundation for comprehensive integration testing 
5. Reduce testing costs by minimizing actual API calls
6. Improve test reliability by removing external dependencies

## Focus Area: test-single-query-workflow.js

Our immediate focus is migrating the `test-single-query-workflow.js` test to Vitest with improved mocking. This test is critical because:

1. It tests a core workflow that powers many user-facing features
2. It currently makes actual API calls to external services
3. It requires sophisticated mocking of both time and network responses
4. It serves as an excellent template for our other workflow tests

### Key Components to Mock

- **Perplexity API calls**: We need to simulate both standard and deep research responses
- **Long-running operations**: The workflow can take up to 30 minutes in real-time
- **Job processing**: Multiple stages of processing need to be simulated
- **Webhook callbacks**: External service callbacks need proper simulation
