# Test Migration Plan: Jest to Vitest

## Why Vitest?

1. **Native ESM Support**: Vitest works with ES modules out of the box
2. **Performance**: Faster startup and parallel test execution
3. **Compatibility**: Jest-compatible API means minimal code changes
4. **Developer Experience**: Watch mode with better UI and debuggability
5. **Simpler Configuration**: Less configuration needed for modern projects

## Migration Steps

### 1. Immediate Actions

- [x] Set up Vitest configuration
- [x] Install required dependencies
- [x] Create consolidated test helper utilities
- [x] Create a unified test runner script
- [ ] Run both Jest and Vitest in parallel during transition

### 2. Incremental Migration (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] Migrate unit tests first
  - [ ] Utility functions
  - [ ] Service layers
  - [ ] Middleware
- [ ] Update CI workflows to run both Jest and Vitest tests
- [ ] Fix any issues discovered during initial migration

### 3. Integration Tests Migration (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] Migrate integration tests
- [ ] Consolidate redundant test scenarios
- [ ] Create more robust mocks for external services

### 4. Manual Test Conversion (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] Convert manual test scripts to proper test suites
- [ ] Create reusable fixtures for test data
- [ ] Implement proper setup/teardown for all tests

### 5. Finalize Migration (1 week)

- [ ] Remove Jest configuration and dependencies
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Update CI/CD to only use Vitest
- [ ] Clean up any temporary compatibility code

## Consolidated Test Structure

```
tests/
├── e2e/              # End-to-end tests
├── integration/      # Integration tests
├── performance/      # Performance and benchmark tests
├── unit/             # Unit tests
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── controllers/
│   └── models/
├── fixtures/         # Shared test fixtures
└── utils/            # Shared test utilities
```

## Redundancies to Address

1. **Duplicate Test Logic**: Consolidate similar test setup in shared utilities
2. **Multiple Test Runners**: Replace the many workflow configurations with the unified runner
3. **Manual Tests**: Convert scripts in `tests/manual/` to proper test suites
4. **Overlapping Test Coverage**: Identify and eliminate redundant test cases

## Benefits of Consolidated Approach

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Shared test utilities eliminate duplicate code
2. **Simplified Execution**: Single command to run different test types
3. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of test types
4. **Improved Performance**: Faster test execution with parallelization
5. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Better watch mode and debugging
