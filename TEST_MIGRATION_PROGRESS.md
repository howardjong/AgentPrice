## Migration Plan

1. **Phase 1: Critical Services** ✅
   - Prioritize core services that interact with external APIs
   - Focus on anthropicService and perplexityService

2. **Phase 2: Utility Functions** ✅
   - Migrate utility function tests
   - Focus on circuitBreaker, apiClient, costTracker, tokenOptimizer, tieredResponseStrategy

3. **Phase 3: Integration Points** ⏳
   - Migrate services that tie multiple components together
   - Focus on serviceRouter, contextManager, etc.

4. **Phase 4: Application Logic** ⏳
   - Migrate business logic and application-specific components
   - Focus on controllers, middleware, etc.

## Completed Migrations

### March 28, 2025
- Successfully migrated perplexityService tests
- Successfully migrated logger tests
- Created backups of original Jest test files
- Confirmed Vitest tests pass with all test cases covered
- Migrated basic apiClient tests (advanced tests pending due to async timeout issues)
- Migrated circuitBreaker tests for both implementations
- Completed migration of costTracker tests (16 tests passing)
- Completed migration of tokenOptimizer tests (18 tests passing)
- Completed migration of tieredResponseStrategy tests (13 tests passing)
- Phase 2 of migration completed except for advanced apiClient tests

## Known Issues

- Advanced apiClient tests with mock adapters are experiencing timeouts in Vitest. 
  The initial set of basic tests works correctly, but additional work needed for advanced tests.
- Need to investigate alternative approaches for mocking axios in Vitest.

## Next Steps

1. Finish the advanced apiClient tests migration
2. Begin Phase 3 migration with serviceRouter and contextManager
3. Update scripts to handle additional test types
4. Continue progressive migration of remaining tests
