# Test Migration Progress

This document tracks the progress of migrating Jest unit tests to Vitest.

## Migration Status

| Service/Component | Jest Test | Vitest Test | Status | Date Completed |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| anthropicService  | N/A       | ‚úÖ anthropicService.vitest.js | Complete | March 28, 2025 |
| perplexityService | ‚úÖ Removed | ‚úÖ perplexityService.vitest.js | Complete | March 28, 2025 |
| logger            | ‚úÖ Removed | ‚úÖ logger.vitest.js | Complete | March 28, 2025 |
| apiClient         | ‚úÖ Backup  | ‚úÖ apiClient.vitest.js (basic) | Partial  | March 28, 2025 |
| circuitBreaker    | ‚úÖ Backup  | ‚úÖ circuitBreaker.vitest.js | Complete | March 28, 2025 |

## Migration Plan

1. **Phase 1: Critical Services** ‚úÖ
   - Prioritize core services that interact with external APIs
   - Focus on anthropicService and perplexityService

2. **Phase 2: Utility Functions** üîÑ
   - Migrate utility function tests
   - Focus on circuitBreaker, apiClient, costTracker, etc.

3. **Phase 3: Integration Points** ‚è≥
   - Migrate services that tie multiple components together
   - Focus on serviceRouter, contextManager, etc.

4. **Phase 4: Application Logic** ‚è≥
   - Migrate business logic and application-specific components
   - Focus on controllers, middleware, etc.

## Completed Migrations

### March 28, 2025
- Successfully migrated perplexityService tests
- Successfully migrated logger tests
- Created backups of original Jest test files
- Confirmed Vitest tests pass with all test cases covered
- Migrated basic apiClient tests (advanced tests pending due to async timeout issues)
- Migrated circuitBreaker tests for both implementations

## Known Issues

- Advanced apiClient tests with mock adapters are experiencing timeouts in Vitest. 
  The initial set of basic tests works correctly, but additional work needed for advanced tests.
- Need to investigate alternative approaches for mocking axios in Vitest.

## Next Steps

1. Continue with costTracker and tokenOptimizer tests
2. Update scripts to handle additional test types
3. Continue progressive migration of remaining tests
