# Test Migration Progress

This document tracks the progress of migrating Jest unit tests to Vitest.

## Migration Plan

1. **Phase 1: Critical Services** ✅
   - Prioritize core services that interact with external APIs
   - Focus on anthropicService and perplexityService

2. **Phase 2: Utility Functions** ✅
   - Migrate utility function tests
   - Focus on circuitBreaker, apiClient, costTracker, tokenOptimizer, tieredResponseStrategy

3. **Phase 3: Integration Points** ⏳
   - Migrate services that tie multiple components together
   - Focus on serviceRouter, contextManager, etc.

4. **Phase 4: Application Logic** ⏳
   - Migrate business logic and application-specific components
   - Focus on controllers, middleware, etc.

## Completed Migrations

### March 28, 2025
- Successfully migrated perplexityService tests
- Successfully migrated logger tests
- Created backups of original Jest test files
- Confirmed Vitest tests pass with all test cases covered
- Migrated circuitBreaker tests for both implementations
- Completed migration of costTracker tests (16 tests passing)
- Completed migration of tokenOptimizer tests (18 tests passing)
- Completed migration of tieredResponseStrategy tests (13 tests passing)
- Completed migration of apiClient tests, including advanced HTTP retry tests with axios-mock-adapter
- Successfully completed Phase 2 of the migration plan

## Known Issues

- Some tests may show unhandled promise rejections related to Vite's development server connection.
  These are benign and don't affect test results, but could be addressed in future refinements.

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 3 migration with serviceRouter and contextManager
2. Update scripts to handle additional test types
3. Continue progressive migration of remaining tests
4. Implement websocket tests with the migration approach established for HTTP requests
