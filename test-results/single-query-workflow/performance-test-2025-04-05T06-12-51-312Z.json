  "researchContent": "Recent advancements in renewable energy storage have been substantial, with several breakthrough technologies reaching commercial viability in the past 2-3 years.\n\nFor grid-scale storage:\n1. Flow batteries have seen significant improvements, with vanadium redox flow batteries now achieving 80-90% round-trip efficiency and 20+ year lifespans.\n\n2. Compressed air energy storage (CAES) has evolved with Hydrostor's Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) technology, which achieves 60-70% efficiency without fossil fuels.\n\n3. Gravity-based storage solutions like Energy Vault's crane and block system can store 35MWh of energy and discharge at 4MW, with 80-90% round-trip efficiency.\n\nFor residential storage:\n1. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries have become dominant due to improved safety and longevity.\n\n2. Solid-state batteries are beginning to enter the market with companies like QuantumScape making progress on commercial production.\n\n3. Salt (sodium-ion) batteries are emerging as a promising alternative to lithium-ion, with CATL announcing mass production.",
