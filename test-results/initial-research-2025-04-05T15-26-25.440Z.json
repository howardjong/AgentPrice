  "content": "When developing a SaaS pricing strategy, three key factors to consider are:\n\n1. **Target Market and Industry**:\n   - Understanding your target market and industry is crucial. Pricing may need to be adjusted based on the budgets and specific needs of different industries or customer segments[2].\n\n2. **Value Proposition and Functionality**:\n   - Assess the specific value your service offers, including its features and how it solves customer problems. This perceived value affects what customers are willing to pay[1][2].\n\n3. **Competitor Pricing and Market Conditions**:\n   - Conduct market research to understand how competitors price similar services. This helps determine where your service fits within the market and ensures your pricing remains competitive[1][4].",
