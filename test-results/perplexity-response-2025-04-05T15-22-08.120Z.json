This includes recognizing the size of businesses you serve, potential market growth, and geographic expansion opportunities. Identifying specific customer segments and their unique needs helps tailor pricing and packaging effectively[5].\n\n2. **Functionality and Value Proposition**:\n   - Assessing the functionality and value proposition of your service is vital. This involves evaluating how your product solves problems, enhances efficiency, and provides unique benefits compared to competitors. Pricing should reflect the perceived value to customers[1].\n\n3. **Competitor Pricing and Market Conditions**:\n   - Conducting market research to understand competitor pricing strategies is essential. This helps determine where your service fits within the market and ensures your pricing is competitive and sustainable. Adjustments may be needed based on market changes or customer feedback[1][4]."
