Okay, I need to tackle this research query about current market pricing models for subscription SaaS products in the productivity space. Let me start by understanding the key components of the query. The user wants a comprehensive analysis focusing on several areas: price comparisons, freemium vs. paid models, feature-based strategies, regional variations, and consumer price sensitivity using Van Westendorp and conjoint analysis.

First, I'll look through the provided search results to gather relevant information. The search results include articles from 2025-03-25, which are recent enough for this task. Let me go through each source to extract useful data.

From source [1], there's a detailed discussion on SaaS pricing pages with examples like Coda.io and FeedHive. They mention different pricing strategies such as action verbs + JTBD (Job-to-be-Done), "For X looking to do Y," and usage-based models. This is useful for feature-based pricing strategies.

Source [5] talks about the pricing software market growth, mentioning cloud-based solutions and AI-driven pricing strategies. It also segments the market into types like Cloud-Based and On-Premise, which could relate to regional variations if certain regions prefer one type over another.

Source [8] discusses automating subscription billing and lists tools like Chargebee and Recurly that support various pricing models including freemium tiers and usage-based billing. This ties into freemium vs. paid models.

Source [9] from Salesforce lists top invoicing software with details on how each handles pricing management. For example, Chargebee supports multiple models like freemiums and tiers. This can help in competitor price comparisons.

Source [12] mentions Grammarly's job posting for a Director of Pricing and Packaging, highlighting their use of Van Westendorp and conjoint analysis for customer research. This directly addresses consumer price sensitivity metrics.

Source [14] has a quote from FreshWorks about shifting from user-based to consumption-based pricing, indicating a trend in the industry towards usage models.

Source [15] discusses B2B SaaS sales trends in 2025, emphasizing product-led growth (PLG) with freemium tiers as expectations now. Examples include Notion and Slack, which are productivity tools.

Now, structuring the answer according to the response guidelines: Executive Summary, Market Overview, Competitive Analysis, Consumer Insights, Recommendations.

For Market Overview: The main trends are tiered feature-based pricing (as seen in Asana, Monday.com), usage-based models (Deepgram), hybrid approaches combining freemium with premium tiers (Notion), regional adjustments (LinkedIn's strategy mentioned in source [6]), AI-driven dynamic pricing (source [5]).

Competitive Analysis: Need to compare direct competitors like Notion vs Coda.io vs Asana. Notion uses freemium with paid tiers based on features; Coda charges per Doc Maker instead of per user; Asana uses "For X looking to do Y" model.

Freemium vs Paid: Source [15] states that freemium is now expected; source [8] mentions tools supporting freemiums but notes conversion challenges via automation benefits.

Feature-Based Strategies: Examples from sources [1], [9], where different tiers have action-oriented labels tied to user goals (e.g., FeedHive's "Grow" plan).

Regional Pricing: Source [5] mentions Asia-Pacific as fastest-growing region; LinkedIn's job post in source [6] might imply localized strategies but needs more data. However, explicit regional variation examples are limited in provided sources except for Stripe supporting multiple currencies (source [9]).

Consumer Price Sensitivity: Source [12] uses Van Westendorp and conjoint analysis; Grammarly applies these methods. Source[6], LinkedIn's job post also requires experience in these methods.

Willingness-to-pay via Conjoint Analysis: Mentioned in sources[6][12], used by companies to determine optimal price points by evaluating feature trade-offs.

Limitations: Some sources don't provide specific data points like exact price thresholds or regional breakdowns beyond mentioning APAC growth. More competitor-specific data might be needed but available info from examples should suffice if cited properly.

Need to ensure all claims are cited correctly using the provided sources without making up data not present.
