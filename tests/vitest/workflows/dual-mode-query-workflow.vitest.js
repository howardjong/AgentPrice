- Growth rate: 8.5% YoY
- Premium segment (>$5/cup): $420 million, growing at 12.3% YoY

## Consumer Insights
- 68% of Bay Area professionals consume specialty coffee 3+ times per week
- 42% willing to pay premium for unique flavors
- 32% specifically interested in "innovative" coffee experiences

## Price Sensitivity
- Too cheap price point: Below $4.50 (perceived as low quality)
- Bargain price point: $5.50-$6.50
- Expected price point: $7.50
- Premium price point: $8.50-$9.50
- Too expensive price point: Above $11

## Competitor Analysis
