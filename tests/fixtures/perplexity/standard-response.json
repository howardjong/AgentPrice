        "content": "Based on my research, the specialty coffee market in the Bay Area is estimated at $1.2 billion annually with 8% growth. Premium coffee experiences ($6+ per cup) represent about 35% of this market.\n\nYour target demographic of 25-45 year-old professionals makes up approximately 65% of specialty coffee consumers in the region. Research indicates that 42% of specialty coffee drinkers report willingness to try innovative coffee experiences.\n\nCompetitor pricing shows Blue Bottle at $5.25-$6.50 (standard), $7.00-$8.50 (reserve); Philz at $4.75-$6.25 (standard), $6.50-$7.50 (specialty); and Sightglass at $5.00-$6.50 (standard), $7.00-$9.00 (limited).\n\nFor your chemistry-infused specialty coffee, I recommend a tiered pricing strategy with standard infusions at $7.50-$8.50, premium infusions at $9.00-$10.00, and limited edition experiences at $11.00-$12.00. This positions you in the premium segment, differentiates from competitors, and should maintain your 35% profit margin.",
