## Merge Strategy

### Preparation
- [ ] Update branch with latest main:
  ```bash
  git checkout your-branch
  git fetch origin
  git rebase origin/main
  # Resolve any conflicts
  ```

- [ ] Create and test integration branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b integration-branch
  # Run comprehensive tests on this branch
  ```

### Pre-Flight Testing
- [ ] Run all tests in isolation mode:
  ```bash
  node scripts/run-vitest.js --run-isolated
  ```

- [ ] Execute performance-sensitive tests separately:
  ```bash
  node scripts/run-vitest.js --testNamePattern "performance" --run-isolated
  ```

- [x] Test Socket.IO components with extra logging:
  ```bash
  DEBUG=socket.io* node scripts/run-vitest.js --testNamePattern "Socket"
  ```
  - Basic Socket.IO tests passing with proper connection/disconnect lifecycle (basic-socketio.vitest.js)
  - More complex reconnection tests showing timeout issues that require investigation
  - Socket.IO debug logs confirmed proper event propagation and connection management
  - Identified specific test case for further analysis: reconnect-edge-cases.vitest.js

- [x] Run database tests with transaction isolation:
  ```bash
  ./run-db-tests.sh
  ```

- [x] Verify database test safety:
  ```bash
  # Check for potential destructive operations
  grep -r "DROP TABLE\|DELETE FROM\|TRUNCATE" ./tests/
  ```

- [ ] Run a memory profile on the test suite:
  ```bash
  node --inspect scripts/run-vitest.js
  # Connect Chrome DevTools and capture memory snapshots
  ```

### Merge Process
- [ ] Prepare detailed merge commit message
- [ ] Schedule merge during low-traffic period (recommend 9-11 AM on Tuesday or Wednesday)
- [ ] Ensure database specialist is available during the merge window
- [ ] Perform the merge
- [ ] Run immediate post-merge verification tests
- [ ] Establish a 48-hour monitoring period with heightened alerting for test failures

## Communication Plan

- [ ] Create detailed PR description including:
  - Summary of all changes
  - Links to key documentation files
  - Coverage improvements metrics
  - Potential impact on development workflow

- [ ] Schedule dedicated code review session focused on:
  - Socket.IO testing patterns
  - Vitest mocking approaches
  - Service consolidation impact
  - Database testing infrastructure and safety protocols
  - Transaction isolation implementation details

- [ ] Create rollout announcement detailing:
  - New testing commands replacing Jest commands
  - How to run and debug tests in the new environment
  - Performance improvements from the migration
  - Database testing capabilities and safeguards
  - How to run database tests with proper isolation
  - Guidelines for creating new database tests safely

## Validation Script

The pre-merge validation script (`pre-merge-validation.js`) should be run to:
- Check for any remaining Jest imports
- Verify no anthropicService references remain
- Ensure Claude service includes standard model references
- Check Socket.IO tests for proper cleanup patterns
- Verify Jest removal is complete
- Check for consistent test patterns
- Verify database tests use transaction isolation
- Check for potential destructive database operations
- Validate that database tests use unique test data
- Confirm database tests follow documented patterns

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback Procedure
If critical issues are discovered immediately after merge:
```bash
git revert <merge-commit-hash>
```

### Partial Rollback Options
- Option to revert service consolidation only
- Option to revert Socket.IO testing changes only
- Process to restore Jest if needed

### Recovery Steps for Major Components
- Step-by-step recovery procedures for:
  - Claude Service
  - Perplexity Service
  - Socket.IO testing
  - Search Utilities:
    1. Revert utils/searchUtils.js to restore original function structure
    2. Revert tests/unit/utils/searchUtils.vitest.js to pre-extraction version
    3. Run `node scripts/fix-search-utils-tests.js` to apply necessary fixes
    4. Alternatively, use the simplified test file as a base (searchUtils.simple.vitest.js)
  - Database testing infrastructure
  
### Database Testing Recovery
If database testing issues are encountered:
1. Revert to in-memory storage for affected tests
2. Disable transaction isolation if it's causing connection issues
3. Use the mock-storage pattern until database issues are resolved
4. Check for any potential schema conflicts with the current database

## Post-Merge Verification

- [ ] Run immediate verification of critical paths:
  ```bash
  node scripts/verify-critical-paths.js
  ```

- [ ] Run full test suite:
  ```bash
  node scripts/run-vitest.js
  ```

- [x] Run database-specific tests:
  ```bash
  ./run-db-tests.sh
  ```

- [x] Verify transaction isolation in database tests:
  ```bash
  # Validation is now handled by transaction-isolation.test.ts
  npx vitest run tests/storage/transaction-isolation.test.ts
  ```

- [x] Verify documentation accuracy:
  - [x] Created DATABASE_TESTING_WITH_VITEST.md with comprehensive examples
  - [x] Created DATABASE_TESTING_PATTERNS.md with detailed patterns explanation
  - [x] Verified examples match implemented test patterns
  - [x] Ensured DbTestUtils documentation matches implementation

- [ ] Check for performance regressions:
  ```bash
  node scripts/performance-comparison.js
  ```

- [x] Verify database test safety:
  ```bash
  # Database safety verification now integrated into run-db-tests.sh
  ./run-db-tests.sh
  ```

## Notes and Observations

1. **Inconsistent Test Patterns Warning**:
   - The pre-merge validation script reports warnings about inconsistent test patterns in many test files.
   - These warnings are non-critical and do not affect the functionality of the tests.
   - A future ticket should be created to address these inconsistencies and standardize the test patterns across all test files.
   - For now, these warnings can be safely ignored for the merge.

2. **Jest Dependency Removal**:
   - The Jest dependencies have been successfully removed from package.json using the `scripts/remove-jest-dependencies.js` script.
   - A backup of the original package.json has been created at package.json.jest-backup.
   - The node_modules directory has been updated to reflect these changes.

3. **Socket.IO Test Cleanup**:
   - All Socket.IO tests have been updated with proper cleanup patterns using the `scripts/fix-socketio-cleanup.js` script.
   - Socket.IO tests now properly implement removeAllListeners() to ensure clean teardown of event listeners.
   - Backups of the original Socket.IO test files are stored in the tests/backups/websocket/ directory.
   - DEBUG=socket.io* logging shows correct connection lifecycle in basic tests.
   - Some complex reconnection tests (reconnect-edge-cases.vitest.js) show timing issues.
   - The explicit event tracking system is functioning correctly based on debug logs.
   - Future improvements needed: increase timeouts for complex reconnection scenarios.

4. **ES Module Compatibility**:
   - Created and verified `fix-esm-flags.js` script to automatically add __esModule: true flags to ES module mocks.
   - Added demo test files (searchUtils.vitest.js and esmoduleFlags.vitest.js) to showcase proper ES module mocking.
   - Created comprehensive documentation in esm-mocking-explained.md to guide developers.
   - Common issues identified: 120 files missing vi.resetModules(), 98 files missing proper cleanup, 115 files with incorrect mocking order.
   - Two main approaches documented for fixing vi.mock() ordering issues: 1) reordering statements and 2) using hoistingImports: true (preferred).

5. **Search Utilities Improvements**:
   - Extracted the _performTextSearch function to improve testability and allow proper mocking.
   - Implemented dependency injection pattern in search function to facilitate testing.
   - Created scripts/fix-search-utils-tests.js to automate test fixes.
   - Added documentation in TESTING_PATTERNS_FOR_SEARCH_UTILS.md to guide developers.
   - Fixed all failing tests by properly mocking the extracted function.
   - Created a simplified test suite (searchUtils.simple.vitest.js) as an example of the improved approach.

6. **Database Testing Integration**:
   - Created comprehensive database testing infrastructure with transaction isolation pattern.
   - Implemented `run-db-tests.sh` script for database test execution with proper safeguards.
   - Created database schema verification script for automatic validation.
   - Fixed pre-merge validation script to work properly with ES modules for database tests.
   - Safeguards implemented to prevent destructive changes to databases:
     * Transaction isolation for all database tests
     * Unique test data generation with timestamps via DbTestUtils
     * No schema modification in tests
     * Test database environment check with the following code in all database tests:
     ```typescript
     beforeAll(() => {
       if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL.includes('test')) {
         throw new Error('Tests should only run against a test database');
       }
     });
     ```
   - Created DbTestUtils class with extensive utilities for database testing:
     * Transaction management
     * Unique test data generation
     * Cleanup helpers
     * Query execution with timeouts
   - Documented best practices in DATABASE_TESTING_WITH_VITEST.md and DATABASE_TESTING_PATTERNS.md.
   - Created three example test patterns: PostgreSQL storage testing, mock storage testing, and transaction isolation testing.
   - Pre-merge validation confirms no destructive operations in database test suite.
   - Added dedicated transaction isolation test to verify database safety mechanisms.
