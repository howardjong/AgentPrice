# Jest to Vitest Migration Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the migration of our test suite from Jest to Vitest, with a current focus on unit tests.

## Migration Status

| Category     | Total Tests | Migrated | Passing | Remaining |
|--------------|-------------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Unit Tests   | TBD         | TBD      | TBD     | TBD       |
| Integration  | N/A         | N/A      | N/A     | N/A       |
| End-to-End   | N/A         | N/A      | N/A     | N/A       |

_Note: Integration and End-to-End tests will be migrated in future phases._

## Migration Process

The migration is following this process:

1. ✅ Research and plan the migration approach
2. ✅ Set up Vitest configuration
3. ✅ Create testing utilities and helpers for Vitest
4. ✅ Migrate unit tests for core services
   - ✅ anthropicService
   - ✅ perplexityService
5. 📋 Verify all migrated tests pass
6. 📋 Generate removal plan for Jest tests
7. 📋 Execute Jest test removal in batches
8. 📋 Update CI/CD configuration
9. 📋 Remove Jest configuration

## Completed Migrations

| resourceManager       | ❌ TODO | Not started                               |
| tokenOptimizer        | ❌ TODO | Not started                               |

## Benefits of Migration

- **ESM Compatibility**: Vitest properly supports ES Modules
- **Performance**: Faster test execution with Vitest
- **Memory Management**: Better memory behavior in Vitest
- **Developer Experience**: Better error reporting and debugging tools

## Next Steps

1. Complete migration of remaining unit tests
2. Run the preparation script to identify all tests ready for removal
3. Execute the removal in batches, starting with low-risk utility tests
4. Proceed with integration and E2E test migration in the future

## Issues and Resolutions

| Issue                                 | Resolution                                                         |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ESM imports failing in Jest           | Migrated to Vitest which properly supports ESM                     |
| Memory leaks during test execution    | Implemented proper cleanup in beforeEach/afterEach                 |
| Hoisting behavior differences         | Updated mock imports to account for Vitest's hoisting behavior     |
| API mock consistency                  | Created standardized mocking patterns in testing guide             |
