# Test Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the test suite, including test coverage reports, testing patterns, and tutorials for implementing robust tests for different components.

## Directory Structure

- [`/coverage`](#coverage-reports): Coverage improvement documents
- [`/patterns`](#testing-patterns): Reusable testing patterns
- [`/tutorials`](#tutorials): Step-by-step guides

## Coverage Reports

The `/coverage` directory contains reports on test coverage improvements for specific components:

- [**TESTING_SUITE_IMPROVEMENTS_2025-04-01.md**](./coverage/TESTING_SUITE_IMPROVEMENTS_2025-04-01.md): High-level summary of test coverage improvements for CircuitBreaker and RobustAPIClient
- [**CIRCUIT_BREAKER_COVERAGE_IMPROVEMENTS_2025-04-01.md**](./coverage/CIRCUIT_BREAKER_COVERAGE_IMPROVEMENTS_2025-04-01.md): Detailed coverage improvements for the CircuitBreaker component
- [**API_CLIENT_COVERAGE_IMPROVEMENTS_2025-04-01.md**](./coverage/API_CLIENT_COVERAGE_IMPROVEMENTS_2025-04-01.md): Detailed coverage improvements for the RobustAPIClient component

## Testing Patterns

The `/patterns` directory contains documentation on reusable testing patterns:

- [**RESILIENT_API_TESTING_PATTERNS.md**](./patterns/RESILIENT_API_TESTING_PATTERNS.md): Comprehensive collection of testing patterns for resilient API components, including time-based testing, state machine testing, and error handling testing

## Tutorials

The `/tutorials` directory contains step-by-step guides for implementing tests:

- [**CREATING_RESILIENT_API_TESTS.md**](./tutorials/CREATING_RESILIENT_API_TESTS.md): Detailed tutorial for creating comprehensive tests for API-related components

## Getting Started

If you're new to testing in this project, we recommend the following approach:

1. Read the high-level [Testing Suite Improvements](./coverage/TESTING_SUITE_IMPROVEMENTS_2025-04-01.md) document to understand our testing philosophy and recent improvements
2. Review the [Resilient API Testing Patterns](./patterns/RESILIENT_API_TESTING_PATTERNS.md) document to learn about proven testing patterns
3. Follow the [Creating Resilient API Tests](./tutorials/CREATING_RESILIENT_API_TESTS.md) tutorial when implementing tests for a new component

## Key Testing Principles

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for high branch and statement coverage
2. **Deterministic Time Testing**: Use time mocking for deterministic testing of time-dependent behavior
3. **State Transition Testing**: Test complete lifecycle of components with different states
4. **Error Path Testing**: Thoroughly test error handling and recovery paths
5. **Configuration Testing**: Test with various configuration options, including defaults and edge cases
