# Testing Patterns Summary - April 1, 2025

## Introduction

This document consolidates the successful testing patterns we've established across different components of our application. These patterns provide a reference for future testing efforts and help maintain consistent testing approaches.

## Component-Specific Patterns

### Redis Test Utils (100% Coverage)

#### Key Patterns
1. **Function-Level Coverage Focus**
   - Target specific uncovered functions identified through function-level analysis
   - Test all code paths including error handling and edge cases
   - Use direct method invocation for internal methods

2. **Timeout Testing**
   - Mock timer functions when appropriate
   - Test timeout callbacks with various timeout values
   - Verify callback execution and state after timeout

3. **Complete Constructor Coverage**
   - Test all constructor configurations
   - Verify default settings are applied correctly
   - Test edge cases in constructor options

### Redis Service Recovery (85% Coverage)

#### Key Patterns
1. **Disconnect and Reconnection Testing**
   - Replace real Redis client with a mock that can simulate disconnection
   - Test state transitions during disconnections
   - Test operation behavior during disconnected states
   - Verify successful recovery after reconnection

2. **Error Recovery Testing**
   - Create controlled error conditions using mocks
   - Test behavior when operations encounter errors
   - Verify system can recover after errors are resolved

3. **Timeout Recovery Testing**
   - Simulate timeouts by delaying mock responses
   - Test behavior during timeouts
   - Verify recovery after timeouts

4. **Sequential Operation Testing**
   - Test multiple operations with failures in between
   - Test parallel operations with mixed success/failure outcomes
   - Verify recovery behavior in complex sequences

### Socket.IO Connection Management (80% Coverage)

#### Key Patterns
1. **Self-Contained Test Environments**
   - Create isolated test environments for each test
   - Use dynamic port allocation to prevent conflicts
   - Clean up all resources after each test

2. **Event-Driven Testing**
   - Use promise-based event waiting instead of arbitrary timeouts
   - Test connection events, disconnection, and error conditions
   - Wait for specific events to verify behavior

3. **Comprehensive Resource Tracking**
   - Track all created resources (servers, clients, etc.)
   - Implement two-phase cleanup (disconnect clients, then close servers)
   - Use proper error handling during cleanup

4. **Room Management Testing**
   - Test joining and leaving rooms
   - Verify message delivery to specific rooms
   - Test broadcasting to multiple rooms

## Cross-Component Testing Patterns

### Asynchronous Operation Testing

1. **Promise-Based Event Waiting**
   ```javascript
   function waitForEvent(emitter, event) {
     return new Promise((resolve) => {
       const handler = (...args) => {
         emitter.off(event, handler);
         resolve(args);
       };
       emitter.on(event, handler);
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Controlled Timeouts**
   - Use short timeouts (100-300ms) for testing operations
   - Avoid arbitrary timeout loops
   - Implement proper timeout handling for cleanup operations

### Mock Creation and Configuration

1. **Functional Mocks**
   ```javascript
   function createMockRedisClient() {
     return {
       mock: {
         store: {},
       },
       status: 'ready',
       get: async (key) => { /* ... */ },
       set: async (key, value) => { /* ... */ },
       // Other methods...
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Controlled Failure Simulation**
   ```javascript
   function simulateRedisError(mockClient, method, error) {
     vi.spyOn(mockClient, method).mockImplementation(() => {
       throw error;
     });
   }
   ```

### Resource Cleanup

1. **Two-Phase Cleanup Pattern**
   ```javascript
   // 1. First disconnect all clients
   for (const client of clients) {
     client.removeAllListeners();
     if (client.connected) {
       client.disconnect();
     }
   }
   
   // 2. Close servers with timeout protection
   return new Promise((resolve) => {
     const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
       console.log('Server close timed out, forcing exit');
       resolve();
     }, 300);
     
     server.close(() => {
       clearTimeout(timeout);
       resolve();
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Completion Verification**
   - Verify that disconnects and cleanups have completed
   - Check state after cleanup operations
   - Use proper error handling during cleanup

## Common Testing Patterns

### Error Testing

1. **Error Propagation**
   - Test that errors are properly propagated through the system
   - Verify error objects contain expected information
   - Test error handling at each layer

2. **Recovery Testing**
   - Verify system can recover from errors
   - Test automatic retry mechanisms
   - Verify system state after recovery

### Boundary Condition Testing

1. **Edge Case Identification**
   - Test minimum and maximum values
   - Test empty/null inputs
   - Test unusual or unexpected inputs

2. **Behavior Verification**
   - Verify behavior at boundaries
   - Test transitions between states
   - Verify error handling at boundaries

## Test Structure Best Practices

1. **Focused Test Files**
   - Create specific test files for specific functionality
   - Keep test file size manageable
   - Group related tests together

2. **Descriptive Test Names**
   - Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
   - Include expected behavior in test names
   - Group tests in logical describe blocks

3. **Test Isolation**
   - Ensure tests can run independently
   - Clean up all resources after each test
   - Avoid test dependencies

## Recommended Tools

1. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Use function-level coverage analysis
   - Identify specific uncovered functions
   - Track coverage metrics over time

2. **Mocking Libraries**
   - Use Vitest's built-in mocking capabilities
   - Create specialized mocks for complex components
   - Use consistent mocking patterns

## Next Steps

1. Apply these patterns to the upcoming WebSocket error handling tests
2. Extract common testing utilities into shared modules
3. Create specialized test fixtures for common scenarios
4. Standardize on event-based testing approach
5. Implement proper resource cleanup in all tests
