# Coverage Improvement Plan Update (2025-04-04)

## Executive Summary

We have successfully improved test coverage for the Job Manager service, bringing it up from 35% to 75% with reliable tests that properly mock external dependencies. This builds on our previous success with the Redis service tests.

## Current Status

| Service/Component | Previous Coverage | Current Coverage | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Redis Service     | 45% | 90% | âœ… Completed with documented patterns |
| Job Manager       | 35% | 75% | âœ… Base functionality tested, documented patterns |
| Context Manager   | 45% | 45% | ðŸ”„ Next priority |
| Prompt Manager    | 60% | 60% | Scheduled for future work |
| Research Service  | 40% | 40% | Scheduled for future work |

## Key Accomplishments

### Job Manager Testing Improvements
- Created reliable mocking strategy for both the Bull library and mockJobManager
- Implemented tests for all key public methods in mock mode
- Documented testing patterns for future development work
- Added thorough documentation of testing approach and patterns

### Testing Infrastructure Improvements
- Established clear pattern for ES module mocking in Vitest
- Better handling of environment variables in tests
- Clearer distinction between unit tests and integration tests

## Next Steps

1. **Context Manager Testing** - Apply the successful patterns from Job Manager to Context Manager tests
2. **Socket.IO Tests** - Begin addressing the Socket.IO testing issues using the established patterns
3. **Test Documentation** - Continue to document testing patterns for other services 

## Testing Pattern Documentation

We have created two major documentation files to assist the team:

1. [Redis Testing Patterns](./REDIS_TESTING_PATTERNS_2025-04-02.md)
2. [Job Manager Testing Patterns](./JOB_MANAGER_TESTING_PATTERNS_2025-04-04.md)

## Technical Debt Addressed

- Fixed module mocking issues that were causing test flakiness
- Eliminated reliance on actual Redis connection for unit tests
- Improved test isolation for better reliability
