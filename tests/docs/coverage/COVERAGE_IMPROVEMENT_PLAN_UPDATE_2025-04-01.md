# Coverage Improvement Plan Update - April 1, 2025

## Recent Progress

We've made significant progress on our coverage improvement plan:

### WebSocket Error Handling and Reconnection Testing âœ… COMPLETED

1. **WebSocket Error Handling Tests**
   - Created 7 comprehensive tests covering:
     - Server-side error propagation
     - Client-side error handling
     - Socket middleware error handling
     - Connection timeout handling
     - Server close error handling
     - Clean disconnection handling
     - Socket.IO namespace error handling
   - Coverage increased from ~40% to ~80%

2. **WebSocket Reconnection Tests**
   - Created 5 comprehensive tests covering:
     - Manual client reconnection
     - Automatic reconnection after server restart
     - State recovery after reconnection
     - Handling temporary connection interruptions
     - Robust reconnection after multiple failures
   - Added additional coverage for reconnection edge cases

### Documentation

1. Created `WEBSOCKET_ERROR_HANDLING_PATTERNS_2025-04-01.md` with:
   - Comprehensive description of testing patterns
   - Detailed test strategies for error handling and reconnection
   - Common pitfalls and solutions
   - Integration with other tests
   - Next steps for further improvement

2. Updated `TESTING_PATTERNS_SUMMARY_2025-04-01.md` to reflect latest patterns

## Results

These improvements have:
1. Increased WebSocket error handling coverage from ~40% to ~80%
2. Created a solid foundation for further reconnection testing
3. Documented patterns that can be applied to other component testing
4. Applied the event-driven testing approach successfully
5. Verified that our two-phase cleanup and timeout protection strategies are effective

## Next Steps

### API Client Testing (Next Priority)

We will now focus on improving API Client coverage by:
1. Creating dedicated test files for retry logic, timeouts, and error handling
2. Applying the patterns we've developed in our WebSocket testing
3. Focusing on edge cases and recovery patterns

### Schedule

We are on track with our implementation schedule, having completed all Week 1 and Week 2 targets.

Week 3 will focus on API Client and Circuit Breaker testing, maintaining our momentum toward reaching our coverage goals by the end of April.
