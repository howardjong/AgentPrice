# Perplexity API Error Handling Test Coverage

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive test coverage for error handling in the Perplexity API integration and its supporting components. The goal of these tests is to ensure our system gracefully handles various error scenarios when interacting with the Perplexity API, protecting both the user experience and system stability.

## Testing Approach

Our error handling test strategy employs a layered approach that focuses on three key components:

1. **Perplexity Service Layer** - Testing direct API interaction error handling
2. **RobustAPIClient Layer** - Testing retry logic, backoff mechanisms, and axios error handling
3. **Circuit Breaker Layer** - Testing failure detection, service isolation, and recovery

This multi-layered approach ensures that errors are properly caught, logged, and handled at the appropriate level.

## Test Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `perplexity-error-handling.vitest.js` | Tests for Perplexity service-specific error handling |
| `robustApiClient-error-handling.vitest.js` | Tests for the shared API client error handling functionality |
| `circuitBreaker-error-handling.vitest.js` | Tests for the circuit breaker pattern implementation |

## Error Types Covered

### API-Level Errors
- 400 Bad Request - Invalid parameters
- 401 Unauthorized - API key issues
- 429 Rate Limit Exceeded - API quota exhaustion
- 500 Server Error - Perplexity backend issues
- Network errors - Connection problems

### Logical Error Scenarios
- Input validation errors
- Invalid message format
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Malformed responses

### Resilience Patterns
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Respect for rate limiting headers
- Circuit breaking for persistent failures
- Recovery after service disruption

## Test Patterns and Best Practices

### 1. Test Isolation

Each test is isolated and does not rely on the state from previous tests:

```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.clearAllMocks();
  // Reset environment and create fresh instances
  process.env.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY = 'test-api-key';
  // Mock implementations...
});
```

### 2. Mocking External Dependencies

We mock axios and other dependencies to simulate various error conditions:

```javascript
// Mock a 429 rate limit response
axios.post.mockRejectedValue({
  response: {
    status: 429,
    data: {
      error: 'Too many requests'
    }
  }
});
```

### 3. Testing Complete Error Flows

Tests cover entire error handling flows from initial failure to recovery:

```javascript
// Test full recovery cycle
it('should demonstrate a complete failure recovery cycle', async () => {
  // Step 1: System is healthy (CLOSED)
  expect(circuitBreaker.getState()).toBe('CLOSED');
  
  // Step 2: Failures start occurring
  // Step 3: Circuit opens
  // Step 4: System waits
  // Step 5: Tentative recovery
  // Step 6: Full recovery
  // ...
});
```

### 4. Verification of Error Propagation

Tests verify that errors are properly propagated with appropriate messages:

```javascript
// Verify specific error message for rate limiting
await expect(
  processWebQuery('What is quantum computing?')
).rejects.toThrow('Perplexity API rate limit exceeded');
```

### 5. Verifying Logging and Monitoring

Tests verify that errors are properly logged:

```javascript
// Logger should have recorded the error
expect(logger.error).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
  expect.stringContaining('Error processing web query'),
  expect.objectContaining({
    statusCode: 429
  })
);
```

## Circuit Breaker Pattern Coverage

The circuit breaker is a critical component of our error handling strategy. Tests verify:

1. **State Transitions**
   - CLOSED → OPEN when failure threshold is reached
   - OPEN → HALF_OPEN when timeout elapses
   - HALF_OPEN → CLOSED when success threshold is reached
   - HALF_OPEN → OPEN when failures occur during recovery

2. **Protection Mechanisms**
   - Requests blocked when circuit is OPEN
   - Limited requests allowed when HALF_OPEN
   - Normal operation when CLOSED

3. **Recovery Behavior**
   - Automatic retries with backoff
   - Respect for service recovery signals
   - Proper failure counting and thresholds

## Retry Logic Coverage

The robust API client implements retry logic with exponential backoff. Tests verify:

1. **Retry Decisions**
   - Retry on network errors
   - Retry on 429, 500, 502, 503, 504 status codes
   - No retry on client errors (400, 401, 403, 404)

2. **Backoff Strategy**
   - Exponential increase between retries
   - Jitter to prevent thundering herd
   - Maximum delay capping
   - Respect for Retry-After headers

3. **Retry Limits**
   - Maximum retry attempts enforced
   - Circuit breaker integration
   - Proper error reporting after exhaustion

## Perplexity-Specific Error Handling

Tests for Perplexity-specific error handling verify:

1. **API Error Handling**
   - Proper handling of API key issues
   - Specific error messages for rate limiting
   - Graceful handling of malformed responses

2. **Data Validation**
   - Validation of message formats
   - Validation of conversation structure
   - Handling of invalid inputs

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Continuation of deep research with partial results
   - Handling of partial failures in multi-stage operations
   - Appropriate error messages for user feedback

## Coverage Metrics

These test files collectively target >90% code coverage for the error handling paths in:

- `perplexityService.js`
- `apiClient.js`
- `circuitBreaker.js`

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing** - Create integration tests that verify these components work together correctly
2. **Load Testing** - Verify error handling under high concurrency situations
3. **Chaos Testing** - Introduce deliberate failures to verify resilience
4. **Documentation** - Update API documentation with error handling expectations

## Conclusion

The comprehensive error handling test coverage established in these files ensures that the Perplexity API integration is robust against various failure modes. By testing at multiple layers and focusing on both technical errors and logical error scenarios, we've established a resilient foundation for interacting with external AI services.
