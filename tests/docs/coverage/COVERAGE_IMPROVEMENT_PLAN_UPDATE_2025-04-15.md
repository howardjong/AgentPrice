# Coverage Improvement Plan Update - April 15, 2025

## Overview

This document provides an updated status of our test coverage improvement initiatives. We continue to make progress toward our goal of achieving at least 80% coverage across all critical modules. This update reflects our latest assessment and plans for remaining modules.

## Current Coverage Status

## Updates on High Priority Modules

### 1. Claude Service (65% â†’ 85%)

We've created a comprehensive test improvement plan for the Claude service (see `CLAUDE_SERVICE_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_2025-04-15.md`). Key focus areas include:

- Model extraction and identification from SVG comments
- Specialized visualization types (Van Westendorp, Conjoint Analysis)
- Content block handling edge cases
- Advanced error handling scenarios
- SVG validation and processing

Implementation is scheduled to begin immediately with completion by April 18.

### 2. WebHook Event Handler (71% â†’ 85%)

Next in our priority queue after the Claude service. The coverage plan will focus on:

- Authentication mechanism testing
- Payload validation with various formats
- Error handling for malformed payloads
- Retry strategies for failed deliveries
- Event routing logic verification

### 3. Context Manager (68% â†’ 85%)

This module will require focused testing on:

- Context serialization and recovery
- State management across disconnections
- Multi-user context isolation
- Error handling during context transitions

## Future Improvements

While several modules have reached our target coverage (80%), we've documented future improvements for when resources permit:

1. **Perplexity Service**: Additional refinements documented in `PERPLEXITY_FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS_2025-04-15.md`
2. **Socket.IO and WebSocket Services**: Load testing and high-concurrency testing

## Testing Metrics and Reporting

We'll continue to monitor the following metrics to track our progress:

| Metric | Current Average | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Statement Coverage | 83% | â‰¥85% |
| Branch Coverage | 80% | â‰¥80% |
| Function Coverage | 92% | 100% |
| Line Coverage | 84% | â‰¥85% |

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress with 9 modules now meeting our coverage targets. Our focus is on the remaining 5 modules, starting with the Claude service. We anticipate completing all high-priority modules by April 20 and reaching our overall coverage targets by the end of April.
