# Coverage Improvement Plan Update

**Date:** April 15, 2025 (Updated: April 1, 2025)

## Summary

This document provides an update on our test coverage improvement efforts across key modules. We've been working to systematically improve coverage in all critical modules to at least 80% for branches, lines, functions, and statements.

## Coverage Status

| Module | Previous Coverage | Current Coverage | Status |
|--------|------------------|------------------|--------|
| Perplexity Service | ~65% | ~90% | âœ… Completed |
| Claude Service | ~60% | ~85% | âœ… Completed |
| WebHook Event Handler | ~71% | ~71% | ðŸ”„ Planned |
| Context Manager | ~68% | ~68% | ðŸ”„ Planned |
| Job Queue Manager | ~75% | ~75% | ðŸ”„ Planned |
| Redis Client | ~82% | ~85% | âœ… Completed |
| Circuit Breaker | ~92% | ~95% | âœ… Completed |

## Completed Improvements

### Perplexity Service
- Added comprehensive tests for rate limiting and retry mechanism
- Improved tests for research query handling
- Added tests for context enrichment
- Added tests for source validation
- Enhanced error condition testing
- Implemented tests for specialized query types

### Claude Service
- Created comprehensive test suite in `claudeService-workflow-coverage.vitest.js` aligned with the single-query-workflow
- Added thorough tests for all core functions used in the primary workflow:
  - `processText`: Tested normal operation, custom options, and error handling
  - `processMultimodal`: Tested multimodal content processing, validation, and different content types
  - `processConversation`: Tested conversation history, system prompts, and custom model options
  - `generatePlotlyVisualization`: Tested visualization generation for all chart types
- Enhanced tests for specialized visualization types:
  - Van Westendorp price sensitivity analysis
  - Conjoint Analysis product preferences
- Added robust error handling tests for API failures, timeouts, and malformed responses
- Implemented tests for JSON extraction from different code block formats
- Added service health status reporting tests
- Created documentation of coverage improvements

### Redis Client
- Added tests for complex connection scenarios
- Enhanced error handling tests
- Improved performance monitoring tests

### Circuit Breaker
- Added tests for edge cases
- Enhanced state transition tests
- Improved timeout handling tests

## Planned Improvements

### WebHook Event Handler
- Add tests for event validation
- Implement tests for retry mechanisms
- Add tests for event throttling
- Enhance failure recovery tests

### Context Manager
- Add tests for context merging
- Implement tests for history pruning
- Add tests for persistence edge cases
- Enhance context limit tests

### Job Queue Manager
- Add tests for concurrency controls
- Implement tests for job priorities
- Add tests for job cancellation
- Enhance queue backpressure tests

## Next Steps

1. Begin WebHook Event Handler improvements immediately
2. Continue with Context Manager improvements by April 22, 2025
3. Start Job Queue Manager improvements by April 25, 2025

## Long-Term Goals

- Achieve >85% coverage across all critical modules
- Implement automated coverage regression testing
- Create comprehensive documentation of test coverage strategies
- Establish coverage targets for new modules
