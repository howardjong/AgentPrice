# Test Coverage Status Update - March 31, 2025

## Overview

This document provides a status update on the test coverage improvement initiative, focusing on our migration from Jest to Vitest and addressing key reliability issues with WebSocket and Socket.IO testing.

## Current Status

| Area | Status | Coverage | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| WebSocket Testing | âœ… Completed | 85% | Successfully implemented stable reconnection testing patterns |
| Socket.IO Testing | âœ… Completed | 90% | Created robust test environment with reliable cleanup |
| Prompt Manager | âœ… Completed | 95% | Comprehensive tests for all methods and edge cases |
| Redis Client | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 70% | Redis connection tests still have intermittent issues |
| Anthropic Service | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 65% | Basic tests implemented, complex scenarios pending |
| Perplexity Service | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 60% | Rate limiting tests need improvement |

## Major Achievements

1. **Socket.IO Reconnection Testing Solved**
   - Implemented stable testing patterns using explicit event tracking
   - Created reusable test environment class that properly cleans up resources
   - Eliminated timeout issues by using event-driven waiting instead of fixed delays

2. **Prompt Manager Coverage Improvements**
   - 40+ tests covering all methods and edge cases
   - Comprehensive mocking of file system operations
   - Full coverage of template variable replacement and caching

3. **Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Configured Vitest for coverage reporting with appropriate thresholds
   - Created scripts to generate detailed coverage reports
   - Established test patterns to ensure consistent results

## Strategic Approach

Our approach to improving test coverage has been guided by these principles:

1. **Focus on reliability first, coverage second**
   - Fixing flaky tests before adding new ones
   - Establishing patterns that produce consistent results

2. **Prioritize critical components**
   - Core services and shared utilities first
   - API and integration layers second
   - UI components last

3. **Comprehensive testing at unit level**
   - Mock external dependencies to test pure logic
   - Cover edge cases and error paths
   - Test performance characteristics where relevant

| 5 | Complete context manager tests | April 25 | ðŸ“… Planned |

## Key Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Socket.IO Reconnection Testing

**Problem:** Tests were unstable with unpredictable timeouts and failures.

**Solution:** 
- Created a specialized `SocketTestEnvironment` class
- Used explicit control over reconnection instead of relying on Socket.IO's automatic reconnection
- Implemented event-driven waiting patterns instead of arbitrary delays
- Added ping/pong verification to confirm connection status

### 2. Redis Connection Management

**Problem:** Redis connection tests would intermittently fail due to connection leaks.

**Solution:**
- Implemented proper cleanup with `afterEach` hooks
- Created connection pooling with explicit tracking
- Added timeouts for operations that might hang
- Isolated test databases using unique prefixes

### 3. API Rate Limiting Tests

**Problem:** Tests for rate-limited APIs were unstable and often exceeded actual rate limits.

**Solution:**
- Implemented request mocking instead of real API calls
- Created a rate limit simulation layer
- Added jitter to simulated responses
- Isolated rate limit tests to dedicated test suites

## Documentation Status

| Document | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Socket.IO Testing Best Practices | âœ… Complete | Comprehensive guide with code examples |
| Prompt Service Testing Best Practices | âœ… Complete | Covers all aspects of prompt service testing |
| LLM Service Testing Patterns | ðŸŸ¡ Draft | Initial patterns documented, examples needed |
| Rate Limit Testing Guide | ðŸ“… Planned | Scheduled for April 15 |
| WebSocket Testing Tutorial | âœ… Complete | Focuses on reconnection scenarios |

## Conclusion

We have made significant progress in addressing the most challenging testing areas, particularly WebSocket and Socket.IO reconnection testing. The creation of specialized test environments and utilities has enabled us to write reliable tests for previously unstable components.

The overall test coverage has improved from 65% to 78%, with several key components now exceeding our 80% target. We remain on track to achieve our goal of 85% overall coverage by the end of April.

The next focus areas will be completing the tests for Redis services and implementing comprehensive tests for the LLM integration layer, which includes several external API dependencies.
