## Coverage Measurement Process

1. After implementing each test file, run:
   ```
   npx vitest run <test-file-path> --coverage
   ```

2. For overall coverage assessment, run:
   ```
   npx vitest run --coverage
   ```

3. Update this document with progress after each significant test implementation.

## Test Implementation Guidelines

1. **Mocking External Services**:
   - Use `nock` for HTTP request mocking
   - Use appropriate mocks for Redis, WebSockets, etc.
   - Create reusable mock factories

2. **Preventing API Calls**:
   - No real API calls to Claude or Perplexity in tests
   - Use environment variables to control test modes
   - Create comprehensive mock response libraries

3. **Testing Asynchronous Code**:
   - Use proper async/await patterns in tests
   - Set appropriate timeouts for long-running operations
   - Implement proper cleanup after each test

4. **Error Handling Testing**:
   - Test both happy path and error scenarios
   - Verify error propagation
   - Test recovery mechanisms

5. **Socket.IO Testing Strategy**:
   - Avoid testing actual reconnection sequences due to inherent complexity
   - Focus on testing connection and disconnection as discrete operations
   - Use event simulation for reconnection scenarios rather than forcing actual network disconnections
   - Implement comprehensive client-side event logging for diagnostics
   - Use controlled client configuration with test-optimized settings:
     ```javascript
     {
       reconnectionAttempts: 5,   // Limited attempts for faster test completion
       reconnectionDelay: 100,    // Minimal delay for faster tests
       reconnectionDelayMax: 500, // Bounded max delay
       timeout: 2000,             // Connection timeout
       autoConnect: false,        // Explicit connection control
       forceNew: true,            // Prevent connection pooling issues
     }
     ```
   - Always implement explicit cleanup with server and client disconnection
   - Use the `waitForEvent` utility with timeouts to prevent hanging tests
