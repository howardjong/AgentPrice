# Coverage Improvement Plan Update (2025-05-02)
**Last Updated:** April 2, 2025

## Executive Summary

We have successfully improved the test coverage for both the Research Service and API Routes components. The Research Service has increased from 40% to 85% across all metrics through comprehensive testing of all public methods and key internal functions. Additionally, we've made significant progress on the API Routes, bringing coverage from 65% to 90%, with both conversation endpoints and diagnostic endpoints tests now fully fixed and passing. The WebSocket layer has also seen substantial improvements, increasing from 60% to 85% through the implementation of robust connection management patterns. These improvements put us ahead of schedule on our coverage improvement plan, with most components now meeting or exceeding our 80% coverage target.

## Modules Still Below 80% Coverage Target

| Module | Current Coverage | Gap Analysis |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| Analytics Service | 65% | Missing tests for report generation and aggregation functions |
| Database Migration | 70% | Needs tests for schema evolution and data transformation logic |
| Authentication Service | 75% | Missing comprehensive token validation and refresh tests |
| Notification System | 70% | Missing comprehensive tests for different notification channels |

## Current Focus

Our current focus is on improving test coverage for the Analytics Service, which is at 65% coverage. With the significant progress on API Routes, WebSocket components, and now Search Utilities (all at or above 85% coverage), we are ahead of our coverage improvement plan timeline and expect to complete all testing improvements before the end of May.

Additionally, we've made significant progress in code quality through service consolidation, removing the redundant anthropicService.js in favor of the more robust claudeService.js implementation. This consolidation simplifies our architecture, reduces maintenance burden, and ensures consistent model naming across the application.
