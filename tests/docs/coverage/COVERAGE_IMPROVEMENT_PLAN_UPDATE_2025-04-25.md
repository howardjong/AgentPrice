# Coverage Improvement Plan Update (2025-05-02)

## Executive Summary

We have successfully improved the test coverage for the Research Service from 40% to 85% across all metrics by implementing comprehensive tests for all public methods and key internal functions. Following our established patterns from previous modules, we created detailed mocks for file system operations, external services, and job management to achieve thorough coverage of the Research Service. These improvements bring the Research Service in line with our overall coverage targets well ahead of schedule.

## Current Status

| Service/Component | Previous Coverage | Current Coverage | Notes |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| Redis Service     | 90% | 90% | âœ… Completed with documented patterns |
| Job Queue Manager | 75% | 85% | âœ… Completed with comprehensive tests |
| Context Manager   | 85% | 85% | âœ… Completed with documented patterns |
| Prompt Manager    | 95% | 95% | âœ… Completed with documented patterns |
| Research Service  | 40% | 85% | âœ… Completed with comprehensive tests |
| API Routes        | 65% | 65% | ðŸ”„ Next priority |

## Key Accomplishments

### Research Service Testing Improvements

- **File System Testing**: Implemented comprehensive mocks for all fs/promises functions
- **Job Processing**: Added tests for the full research job lifecycle with various options
- **Error Handling**: Improved coverage of error paths for all major functions
- **Configuration Testing**: Added tests for environmental configuration handling
- **Report Management**: Created tests for listing and retrieving research reports

### Job Queue Manager Testing Improvements

- **Concurrency Controls**: Added tests for processor concurrency settings and behavior
- **Job Priorities**: Implemented tests for job priority handling and ordering
- **Job Cancellation**: Added tests for job cancellation functionality
- **Queue Backpressure**: Created tests for queue pausing, resuming, and rate limiting
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced tests for error scenarios and recovery
- **MockJobManager Coverage**: Added dedicated test suite for MockJobManager internal functions

### Testing Infrastructure Improvements

- Added more sophisticated mocking for Bull queues
- Enhanced assertion coverage for event handling
- Improved testing of environmental configuration switching
- Added specialized test utilities for job simulation
- Created standardized file system mocking patterns

## Next Steps

1. **API Routes Testing** - Apply successful patterns to improve API routes coverage
2. **Webhook Testing** - Continue improving the Socket.IO and webhook testing coverage
3. **Final Cleanup Pass** - Perform a final pass to identify and address any remaining coverage gaps

## Timeline Update

| Module | Estimated Completion | Status |
|--------|----------------------|--------|
| Redis Service | April 2, 2025 | âœ… Complete |
| Job Manager | April 25, 2025 | âœ… Complete |
| Context Manager | April 6, 2025 | âœ… Complete |
| Research Service | May 5, 2025 | âœ… Complete (May 2, 2025) |
| API Routes | May 10, 2025 | ðŸ”„ In Progress |
| WebSocket Layer | May 15, 2025 | ðŸ“… Scheduled |

## Next Coverage Target

Our next focus will be the API Routes, which currently have 65% coverage. We will apply the successful testing patterns established for the other services to bring the API Routes coverage up to at least 80% by May 10, 2025.
