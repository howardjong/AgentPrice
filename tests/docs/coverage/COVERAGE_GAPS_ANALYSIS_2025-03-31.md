# Coverage Gaps Analysis - March 31, 2025

## Overview

Based on our coverage reports and analysis, this document outlines the remaining coverage gaps in our codebase that need attention. While we've achieved 100% coverage for redis-test-utils.js and significant improvements in Socket.IO testing, several components still require additional test coverage.

## Redis Components

| Component | Status | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| redis-test-utils.js | âœ… Complete | 100% (Functions, Lines, Statements, Branches) | 80% | Achieved perfect coverage with 68 tests |
| redisService.js | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 70% | 80% | Need to cover error handling and disconnection recovery |
| redisClient.js | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 65% | 80% | Current tests have intermittent failures |

## API Integration Components

| Component | Status | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| apiClient.js | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 75% | 80% | Missing coverage for retry logic and timeout handling |
| circuitBreaker.js | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 65% | 80% | Need tests for half-open state recovery |
| perplexityService.js | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 60% | 80% | Rate limiting tests need improvement |

## Core Services

| Component | Status | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| anthropicService.js | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 65% | 80% | Basic tests implemented, complex scenarios pending |
| serviceRouter.js | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 75% | 80% | Need coverage for fallback scenarios |
| promptManager.js | âœ… Complete | 95% | 80% | Comprehensive tests for all methods |
| jobManager.js | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | 70% | 80% | Need tests for job failure recovery |

## Priority Action Items

1. **Redis Service**
   - Implementation needed: Add recovery tests for connection failures
   - Implementation needed: Test error state handling

2. **API Client**
   - Implementation needed: Cover retry logic with various delay patterns
   - Implementation needed: Test error propagation and handling

3. **Circuit Breaker**
   - Implementation needed: Add tests for failure threshold behavior
   - Implementation needed: Test recovery patterns after failure

4. **Perplexity Service**
   - Implementation needed: Create comprehensive mocks for API responses
   - Implementation needed: Improve rate limit handling tests

## Next Steps

1. Create targeted test files for each component with <80% coverage
2. Prioritize components used in critical paths
3. Focus on edge cases and error handling scenarios
4. Reuse test patterns from successful components (redis-test-utils.js)
5. Update this document weekly as coverage improves
