# Coverage Improvement Plan - April 1, 2025 (Updated)

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to address the coverage gaps identified in our analysis. We'll focus on specific strategies for each component, applying the lessons learned from achieving 100% coverage on redis-test-utils.js and our progress with Redis service recovery and Socket.IO connection management testing.

## Progress Update (April 1, 2025)

### âœ… Completed Items

1. **Redis Test Utils**: Achieved 100% coverage for all metrics (27/27 functions, 260/260 lines, 260/260 statements, and 54/54 branches)
2. **Redis Service Recovery**: Created `redisService.recovery.vitest.js` with 14 comprehensive tests covering disconnect/reconnect patterns, error recovery, and timeouts
3. **Socket.IO Connection Management**: Created `connection-management.vitest.js` with 5 tests covering connection establishment, room management, disconnection, error handling, and server restart recovery

### ðŸ“š Documentation Created

1. `REDIS_TEST_UTILS_COVERAGE_PATTERNS_2025-03-31.md` - Documenting patterns for utility testing
2. `REDIS_SERVICE_RECOVERY_PATTERNS_2025-03-31.md` - Documenting patterns for service recovery testing
3. `SOCKET_CONNECTION_MANAGEMENT_PATTERNS_2025-04-01.md` - Documenting patterns for WebSocket connection testing

## Guiding Principles

1. **Targeted Testing**: Create specific test files focused on improving coverage for a single component
2. **Edge Case Coverage**: Prioritize tests for error conditions and boundary cases
3. **Reusable Patterns**: Apply successful patterns from completed components to other components
4. **Coverage Analysis**: Use function-level coverage analysis to identify specific gaps
5. **Resource Management**: Ensure proper cleanup of resources in tests to prevent flakiness
6. **Event-Driven Testing**: Utilize event-based approaches for asynchronous testing

## Component-Specific Plans

### 1. WebSocket Error Handling (Current: 40%, Target: 80%) - NEXT PRIORITY

#### Test Files to Create
- `websocket-error-handling.vitest.js` - Comprehensive error handling tests
- `websocket-reconnection.vitest.js` - Manual reconnection patterns

#### Test Strategies
- Apply the successful patterns from Socket.IO connection management testing
- Create controlled failure scenarios for various WebSocket operations
- Test error propagation through the WebSocket stack
- Create timeout simulation and recovery tests
- Test connection state after various error conditions

### 2. API Client (Current: 75%, Target: 80%)

#### Test Files to Create
- `apiClient.retry.vitest.js` - Focused on retry logic
- `apiClient.timeout.vitest.js` - Timeout handling tests
- `apiClient.error.vitest.js` - Error propagation tests

#### Test Strategies
- Mock HTTP responses to simulate various failure modes
- Test progressive backoff with timing verification
- Create adaptive retry scenarios
- Test timeout at various stages (DNS, connection, response)
- Verify proper error classification and handling

### 3. Circuit Breaker (Current: 65%, Target: 80%)

#### Test Files to Create
- `circuitBreaker.state-transition.vitest.js` - State transition tests
- `circuitBreaker.threshold.vitest.js` - Failure threshold tests
- `circuitBreaker.reset.vitest.js` - Recovery pattern tests

#### Test Strategies
- Test each state transition with controlled triggers
- Verify failure count tracking
- Test half-open state behavior with success and failure
- Verify proper reset after successful operations
- Test time-based recovery patterns

### 4. Perplexity Service (Current: 60%, Target: 80%)

#### Test Files to Create
- `perplexityService.core.vitest.js` - Basic API functionality
- `perplexityService.rate-limiting.vitest.js` - Rate limit handling
- `perplexityService.error.vitest.js` - Error recovery patterns

#### Test Strategies
- Create comprehensive mock response library
- Test rate limiting with various patterns
- Verify retry behavior with backoff
- Test streaming response handling
- Test error propagation through service layers

## Success Patterns to Apply

### From Redis Test Utils Testing
1. **Multiple Test Files with Clear Focus**
   - Main test file for core functionality
   - Enhanced test file for edge cases
   - Function-coverage test file for specific uncovered functions

2. **Testing Timeout Callbacks**
   - Direct invocation of timeout methods
   - Verify callback execution
   - Test with various timeout values

### From Redis Service Recovery Testing
1. **Mock Service Integration**
   - Properly isolate service components for deterministic testing
   - Create controlled error conditions using mocks
   - Test behavior during timeouts and after timeouts resolve

2. **Recovery Flow Patterns**
   - Test sequential operations with errors or disconnections between them
   - Test parallel operations with different outcomes
   - Verify system can recover after errors are resolved

### From Socket.IO Connection Management Testing
1. **Isolated Test Environment**
   - Create self-contained environments for each test
   - Use dynamic port allocation to prevent conflicts
   - Track all created resources for proper cleanup

2. **Two-Phase Cleanup**
   - First disconnect clients, remove event listeners
   - Then close servers in the correct order
   - Implement proper timeout handling for cleanup operations

3. **Event-Driven Testing**
   - Use promise-based event waiting for asynchronous tests
   - Avoid arbitrary timeouts where possible
   - Test reconnection through controlled server restarts

The goal is to achieve at least 80% coverage for all critical components by the end of April 2025.

## Success Criteria

A component is considered fully covered when:
1. At least 80% of functions, lines, statements, and branches are covered
2. All critical error paths are tested
3. Edge cases and boundary conditions have explicit tests
4. No known bugs or issues remain untested
5. Testing patterns are documented for future reference

## Tools and Resources

We will continue to use and improve our analysis tools:
- extract-function-coverage.js for per-function analysis
- find-uncovered-functions.js for identifying specific gaps
- coverage reporting scripts for overall metrics

## Recommendations

1. **Create Shared Utilities**: Extract common test patterns into shared utility modules
2. **Develop Test Fixtures**: Create specialized test fixtures for common testing scenarios
3. **Standardize on Event-Based Testing**: Use events rather than timeouts for asynchronous tests
4. **Apply Two-Phase Cleanup**: Implement proper resource cleanup in all tests

## Documentation

For each component that reaches target coverage, we will create detailed documentation of:
1. Testing patterns used
2. Edge cases covered
3. Mocking strategies
4. Lessons learned
5. Code examples for future reference
