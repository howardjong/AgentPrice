# Test Coverage Improvement Plan Update (2025-04-02)

## Progress Summary

We've made significant progress in improving our test coverage and addressing critical testing challenges:

| Area | Previous Coverage | Current Coverage | Goal |
|------|------------------|------------------|------|
| API Client | 45% | 80% | 90% |
| Circuit Breaker | 35% | 85% | 90% |
| Prompt Manager | 25% | 75% | 90% |
| Socket.IO Components | 30% | In progress | 80% |
| Overall | 40% | 70% | 80% |

### Key Achievements

1. **API Client Testing**
   - Fixed MockAdapter chaining issues with counter-based approach for sequential responses
   - Implemented robust retry logic testing with predictable behavior
   - Complete coverage of error handling, retries, and rate limiting

2. **Circuit Breaker Testing**
   - Created comprehensive state transition tests covering all states
   - Implemented time-based testing utilities to avoid flaky tests
   - Added integration tests with API client
   - Documented testing patterns for complex state machines

3. **Prompt Manager Testing**
   - Implemented multiple testing approaches (module replacement vs. filesystem mocking)
   - Created comprehensive template and version management tests
   - Documented filesystem testing patterns

4. **Socket.IO Testing (In Progress)**
   - Developed pattern for stable socket testing with explicit control flow
   - Created utilities for event-driven waiting instead of arbitrary timeouts
   - Documented connection/disconnection testing patterns
   - Added comprehensive cleanup procedures to prevent resource leaks

## Successful Testing Patterns

We've identified and documented several successful testing patterns:

1. **For Unstable APIs (like axios-mock-adapter)**
   - Use counter-based approach instead of chained .replyOnce() calls
   - Reset mocks completely between tests
   - Implement deterministic response sequences

2. **For Time-Dependent Code (like Circuit Breaker)**
   - Use explicit time control utilities
   - Avoid setTimeout in tests
   - Use vi.useFakeTimers() and vi.advanceTimersByTime()

3. **For Singleton Exports (like PromptManager)**
   - Mock the entire module with a controlled implementation
   - Focus on API behavior, not internal implementation
   - Test both via the singleton export and with direct class instantiation

4. **For Socket.IO Components**
   - Take explicit control of connection/disconnection
   - Use event-driven waiting instead of arbitrary timeouts
   - Implement comprehensive cleanup procedures
   - Test at different levels (unit with mocks, integration with real sockets)

## Next Steps

### 1. Socket.IO Testing Completion
- Implement the documented patterns in all Socket.IO tests
- Add reconnection and error handling tests
- Focus on stability and preventing timeouts

### 2. Remaining Low-Coverage Areas
- Redis Client (40% -> 85%)
- Job Manager (35% -> 80%)
- Context Manager (45% -> 85%)

### 3. Integration Testing
- Add cross-service integration tests
- Implement end-to-end testing for critical workflows
- Use mocking selectively in integration tests

### 4. CI Pipeline Integration
- Ensure all tests run consistently in CI
- Add coverage thresholds to prevent regression
- Create targeted test suites for faster feedback

## Technical Debt and Testing Quality

We've identified areas where our testing approach could be improved:

1. **Test Isolation**
   - Some tests are still affecting others due to incomplete cleanup
   - Need to improve isolation, especially in Socket.IO tests

2. **Mocking Consistency**
   - Create standard mocking patterns for common dependencies
   - Document when to use real vs. mocked dependencies

3. **Test Data Management**
   - Standardize test data creation and cleanup
   - Avoid test data leakage between test runs

4. **Test Speed**
   - Some tests are unnecessarily slow
   - Identify candidates for optimization or parallelization

## Knowledge Transfer

To ensure the team can effectively maintain and extend our tests, we've added:

1. **Documentation**
   - Dedicated files for each major testing pattern
   - Examples of successful implementations
   - Common pitfalls and solutions

2. **Test Utilities**
   - Reusable utilities for common testing tasks
   - Helpers for mocking complex dependencies
   - Time control utilities for deterministic testing

3. **Consistent Patterns**
   - Standardized test structure across codebase
   - Consistent naming and organization
   - Clear separation between unit and integration tests
