## Perplexity API Testing Highlights

The new Perplexity API testing approach includes:

1. **HTTP Error Handling**:
   - Testing specific HTTP error codes (429, 401, etc.)
   - Verifying appropriate error messages
   - Confirming error logging with context

2. **Input Validation Testing**:
   - Validating message format requirements
   - Testing edge cases in conversation structure
   - Verifying proper error messages for validation failures

3. **Deep Research Testing**:
   - Testing multi-step API call sequences
   - Verifying handling of follow-up question generation
   - Testing error handling at different stages of research

4. **Health Status Reporting**:
   - Verifying correct API key presence detection
   - Testing circuit breaker status reporting
   - Confirming appropriate status values

## Key Testing Patterns Established

1. **API Error Response Testing**:
   ```javascript
   // Mock a 429 rate limit response
   axios.post.mockRejectedValue({
     response: {
       status: 429,
       data: {
         error: 'Too many requests'
       }
     }
   });

   // Verify proper error handling
   await expect(
     processWebQuery('What is quantum computing?')
   ).rejects.toThrow('Perplexity API rate limit exceeded');

   // Verify error logging
   expect(logger.error).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
     expect.stringContaining('Error processing web query'),
     expect.objectContaining({
       statusCode: 429
     })
   );
   ```

2. **Sequence API Call Testing**:
   ```javascript
   // Reset the counter before the test
   axios.post.mockClear();
   
   // Mock a sequence of API calls
   axios.post.mockImplementationOnce(() => Promise.resolve(initialResponse))
          .mockImplementationOnce(() => Promise.resolve(followUpResponse))
          .mockImplementationOnce(() => Promise.resolve(synthesisResponse));
   
   // Execute deep research
   const result = await conductDeepResearch('What is quantum computing?');
   
   // Verify result structure
   expect(result).toEqual(expect.objectContaining({
     content: 'Final synthesized research',
     requestId: expect.any(String)
   }));
   
   // Verify the correct number of API calls
   expect(axios.post).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3);
   ```

3. **Service Health Status Testing**:
   ```javascript
   // Test with API key present
   process.env.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY = 'test-api-key';
   const health = getHealthStatus();
   expect(health.status).toBe('available');
   
   // Test with API key missing
   delete process.env.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY;
   const healthNoKey = getHealthStatus();
   expect(healthNoKey.status).toBe('unavailable');
   ```

## Next Steps for Coverage Improvement

   - Test proper API key management
   - Verify rate limiting and retry logic
   - Test conversation history management

2. **WebHook Event Handler Testing**:
   - Increase coverage of webhook routing logic
   - Test webhook validation and error handling
   - Create comprehensive webhook event type tests

3. **Socket.IO Testing Completion**:
   - Complete migration to event-driven testing
   - Test room management and broadcasting
   - Verify namespace handling

## Action Items

1. **Anthropic Service Test Development**:
   - Create basic error handling tests for Anthropic service
   - Implement mocks for Anthropic API responses
   - Test Anthropic-specific functionality

2. **WebHook Handler Test Implementation**:
   - Develop webhook event routing tests
   - Create test fixtures for webhook payloads
   - Implement webhook authentication tests

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update coverage improvement plan
   - Document Anthropic testing patterns
   - Create webhook testing guide

## Lessons Learned

1. **Effective API Testing Patterns**:
   - Mock sequence testing is crucial for multi-step API flows
   - Testing error handling requires specific HTTP status codes
   - Validating error messages improves test comprehensiveness

2. **Input Validation Testing**:
   - Testing edge cases reveals potential vulnerabilities
   - Clear error messages are vital for effective validation
   - Testing with minimal valid inputs increases coverage

3. **Deep Research Testing Considerations**:
   - Multi-step processes require careful sequence mocking
   - Partial failure handling is important to test
   - Request tracking across multiple calls needs verification

## Conclusion

The implementation of Perplexity API service testing represents significant progress in our test coverage improvements. By providing comprehensive tests for error handling, validation, and successful request flows, we've increased our confidence in this critical component of our system.

This progress addresses one of the key priorities identified in our previous update and brings us closer to our target of 95% overall test coverage. The testing patterns established can be applied to other API services like Anthropic, which will be our next focus area.
