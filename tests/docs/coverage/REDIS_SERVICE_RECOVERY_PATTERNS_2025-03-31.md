# Redis Service Recovery Patterns - Testing Documentation

## Test Coverage Strategy and Approach

This document outlines the successful testing patterns and strategies used for achieving thorough coverage of Redis Service recovery patterns in our application.

## Key Testing Patterns

### 1. Disconnect and Reconnection Testing

**Approach:** Test the service's ability to handle client disconnections and reconnect automatically.

**Implementation Patterns:**
- Replace the real Redis client with a mock that can simulate disconnection events
- Test client.status transitions (ready â†’ end)
- Test operation behavior during disconnected states
- Test successful recovery after reconnection

**Example:**
```javascript
// Simulate disconnection
simulateRedisDisconnection(mockRedisClient);

// Verify client appears disconnected
expect(mockRedisClient.status).toBe('end');

// Attempt operations during disconnection
const result = await redisClient.set('key', 'value');
expect(result).toBe(false);  // Operation should fail gracefully

// Simulate reconnection
mockRedisClient.status = 'ready';

// Verify operation succeeds after reconnection
const result2 = await redisClient.set('key2', 'value2');
expect(result2).toBe(true);
```

### 2. Error Recovery Testing

**Approach:** Test the service's ability to handle Redis errors and recover gracefully.

**Implementation Patterns:**
- Create controlled error conditions using mocks
- Test behavior when operations encounter errors
- Verify system can recover after errors are resolved

**Example:**
```javascript
// Simulate error on get
simulateRedisError(mockRedisClient, 'get', new Error('Simulated get error'));

// Verify service handles error gracefully
const value = await redisClient.get('test-key');
expect(value).toBeNull();

// Remove the error simulation
vi.spyOn(mockRedisClient, 'get').mockImplementation(async (key) => {
  return mockRedisClient.mock.store[key] || null;
});

// Verify service recovers after error resolves
const value2 = await redisClient.get('test-key');
expect(value2).toBe('test-value');
```

### 3. Timeout Recovery Testing

**Approach:** Test the service's ability to handle Redis operation timeouts and recover.

**Implementation Patterns:**
- Simulate timeouts by delaying mock responses
- Use short timeouts in tests to avoid long test durations
- Test behavior during timeouts and after timeouts resolve

**Example:**
```javascript
// Simulate timeout on get
simulateRedisTimeout(mockRedisClient, 'get', 50);

// Verify service handles timeout gracefully (with custom timeout)
const value = await redisClient.get('key', { timeout: 25 });
expect(value).toBeNull();

// Remove the timeout simulation
vi.spyOn(mockRedisClient, 'get').mockImplementation(async (key) => {
  return mockRedisClient.mock.store[key] || null;
});

// Verify service recovers after timeout resolves
const value2 = await redisClient.get('key');
expect(value2).toBe('expected-value');
```

### 4. Multiple Sequential Operations Testing

**Approach:** Test the service's ability to handle sequences of operations, especially with errors or disconnections between them.

**Implementation Patterns:**
- Create test sequences that simulate real-world usage patterns
- Mix successful and failing operations in the sequence
- Test parallel operations with different outcomes

**Example:**
```javascript
// Run parallel operations - some will fail, some succeed
const [getResult1, getResult2, setResult] = await Promise.all([
  redisClient.get('key1'),             // Should fail due to error
  redisClient.get('key2'),             // Should fail due to error
  redisClient.set('key3', 'value3')    // Should succeed
]);

// Check mixed results
expect(getResult1).toBeNull();
expect(getResult2).toBeNull();
expect(setResult).toBe(true);
```

### 5. In-Memory Store Testing

**Approach:** Test the fallback InMemoryStore functionality independently to ensure it behaves correctly as a Redis replacement.

**Implementation Patterns:**
- Test key expiration using real timers
- Test key pattern matching
- Test hash operations
- Test event handling

**Example:**
```javascript
// Test expiration
const store = new InMemoryStore();
await store.set('key', 'value', 'EX', 1);
expect(await store.get('key')).toBe('value');
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1100));
expect(await store.get('key')).toBeNull();

// Test pattern matching
await store.set('test:1', 'value1');
await store.set('test:2', 'value2');
const keys = await store.keys('test:*');
expect(keys).toContain('test:1');
expect(keys).toContain('test:2');
expect(keys.length).toBe(2);
```

## Test Helper Functions

### Key Helpers:

1. **createMockRedisClient()** - Creates a mock Redis client with controllable behavior
2. **simulateRedisError()** - Simulates Redis errors for specific operations
3. **simulateRedisTimeout()** - Simulates Redis timeouts for specific operations
4. **simulateRedisDisconnection()** - Simulates Redis disconnection events

## Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Test Interdependence:** Ensure each test properly cleans up after itself to avoid tests affecting each other
2. **Callback Usage:** Modern versions of test frameworks prefer promises over callbacks - use `async/await` pattern instead of `done()`
3. **Mock Store State:** When testing hash operations, ensure you understand the internal structure of the mock's data store
4. **Timeout Values:** Be careful with timeout values - make them short enough for tests but not so short they cause false failures

## Coverage Results

The Redis service recovery patterns are now thoroughly tested with 14 comprehensive tests covering:
- Disconnect and reconnection (4 tests)
- Error recovery (2 tests)
- Timeout recovery (2 tests)
- Multiple sequential operations (2 tests)
- In-memory store behavior (4 tests)

This test suite provides a robust foundation for ensuring Redis operations remain resilient even in the face of network issues, errors, and timeouts.

## Next Steps

1. Apply these patterns to other services with similar network dependencies
2. Consider expanding to test combined recovery scenarios (e.g., timeout + disconnection)
3. Create integration tests that verify these recovery patterns in the context of higher-level operations
