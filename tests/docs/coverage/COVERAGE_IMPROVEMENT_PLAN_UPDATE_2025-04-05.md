# Coverage Improvement Plan Update (2025-04-05)

## Executive Summary

We have successfully improved test coverage for the Context Manager service, bringing it up from 45% to 85% with comprehensive tests that properly mock Redis dependencies and test edge cases. This builds on our previous achievements with the Redis Service and Job Manager tests.

## Current Status

| Service/Component | Previous Coverage | Current Coverage | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Redis Service     | 45% | 90% | âœ… Completed with documented patterns |
| Job Manager       | 35% | 75% | âœ… Completed with documented patterns |
| Context Manager   | 45% | 85% | âœ… Completed with documented patterns |
| Prompt Manager    | 60% | 60% | ðŸ”„ Next priority |
| Research Service  | 40% | 40% | Scheduled for future work |

## Key Accomplishments

### Context Manager Testing Improvements
- Created comprehensive test suite with 22 passing tests
- Added edge case testing for Redis errors and performance edge cases
- Achieved 85% coverage across all methods of the Context Manager
- Created detailed documentation of testing patterns

### Testing Infrastructure Improvements
- Refined the auto-mock approach for reliable testing of Redis-dependent services
- Standardized patterns for testing performance-related code
- Established consistent approach for testing JSON serialization/deserialization

## Next Steps

1. **Prompt Manager Testing** - Apply the successful patterns from Context Manager to Prompt Manager tests
2. **Socket.IO Tests** - Address the Socket.IO testing issues using the established patterns
3. **Research Service** - Begin planning the testing approach for the Research Service

## Testing Pattern Documentation

We have created three major documentation files to assist the team:

1. [Redis Testing Patterns](./REDIS_TESTING_PATTERNS_2025-04-02.md)
2. [Job Manager Testing Patterns](./JOB_MANAGER_TESTING_PATTERNS_2025-04-04.md)
3. [Context Manager Testing Patterns](./CONTEXT_MANAGER_TESTING_PATTERNS_2025-04-05.md)

## Technical Debt Addressed

- Improved test isolation for all services
- Established consistent patterns for testing Redis-dependent services
- Added tests for performance monitoring code that was previously untested
- Created comprehensive documentation for current and future developers
