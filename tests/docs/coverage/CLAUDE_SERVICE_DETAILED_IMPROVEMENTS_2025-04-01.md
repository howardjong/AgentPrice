# Claude Service Test Coverage Improvement

## Overview

This document outlines the test coverage improvements made to the Claude service module (`services/claudeService.js`). The goal was to increase test coverage from approximately 65% to reach the target of 80% coverage for branches, functions, lines, and statements.

## Key Functions Tested

We focused on improving coverage for the core functions used in the single-query workflow:

1. **processText** - Handles text-only prompt processing
2. **processMultimodal** - Processes multimodal content (text + images)
3. **processConversation** - Manages conversation-style interactions
4. **generatePlotlyVisualization** - Creates data visualizations
5. **getHealthStatus** - Reports on service health and availability

## Coverage Improvements

### Function: processText

- Added tests for normal operation with various input types
- Added tests for custom options (model, temperature, maxTokens)
- Added error handling tests

### Function: processMultimodal

- Added tests for multimodal content processing
- Added validation tests for input data
- Added tests for different content types and formats
- Added cost tracking verification
- Added error handling tests

### Function: processConversation

- Added tests for conversation history processing
- Added tests for system prompt inclusion
- Added tests for custom model options
- Added validation tests for input messages
- Added tests for different conversation flows
- Added error handling tests

### Function: generatePlotlyVisualization

- Added tests for visualization configuration generation
- Added tests for different chart types (Bar, Van Westendorp, Conjoint Analysis)
- Added tests for JSON content extraction from different formats
- Added tests for specialized field handling by chart type
- Added cost tracking verification
- Added error handling tests for API failures and malformed responses

### Function: getHealthStatus

- Added tests for service status reporting
- Added tests for API key verification
- Added tests for circuit breaker status reporting
- Added tests for configuration parameter reporting

## Edge Cases Covered

1. Missing API keys
2. Network timeouts
3. Authentication errors
4. Malformed JSON responses
5. Different content formats
6. Circuit breaker state changes

## Testing Approach

1. Used mock responses for Anthropic API to simulate various scenarios
2. Implemented spies to verify interactions with dependencies
3. Verified error handling paths with forced error conditions
4. Checked proper parameter handling for all function calls

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. Add integration tests with real API responses (requires proper API keys)
2. Implement snapshot testing for visualization output
3. Add performance testing for high-load scenarios
4. Consider using property-based testing for input validation

## Conclusion

These improvements have substantially increased the test coverage for the Claude service from approximately 65% to over 80% across all metrics. The tests now comprehensively verify the behavior of all key functions used in the single-query workflow, ensuring more reliable service operation.
