# Vitest Migration Progress

## Migrated Test Files
- ✅ tests/unit/utils/logger.vitest.js
- ✅ tests/unit/utils/circuitBreaker.vitest.js

## Pending Migration
- ⬜ tests/unit/services/researchService.test.js
- ⬜ tests/unit/services/promptManager.test.js
- ⬜ tests/integration tests
- ⬜ tests/manual tests that can be converted to proper test suites

## Known Issues
- ES Module compatibility issues with Jest - expected and handled
- Manual tests for service classes may have different behavior from unit tests due to mocking differences

## Next Steps
1. Continue migrating unit tests
2. Use validation script to confirm test consistency between frameworks
3. Update CI workflows
4. Create reusable test fixtures
5. Convert manual tests to proper test suites where appropriate

## ESM Compatibility Note
For tests with ES Module compatibility issues in Jest:
1. We prioritize Vitest test results over Jest
2. We consider manual tests and Vitest to be the source of truth
3. We accept Jest failures when they're known to be related to ESM compatibility
