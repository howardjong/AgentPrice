# Vitest Migration Progress

*Last Updated: March 28, 2025*

## Migration Progress
For detailed statistics, see `TEST_MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md` (auto-generated).

## Migrated Test Files
- ✅ tests/unit/utils/logger.vitest.js
- ✅ tests/unit/utils/circuitBreaker.vitest.js
- ✅ tests/unit/services/perplexityService.vitest.js
- ✅ tests/unit/services/anthropicService.vitest.js
- ✅ tests/integration/workflow/research.vitest.js

## Recently Created Migration Tools
- ✅ tests/utils/test-helpers.js - Consolidates shared test utilities and mocks
- ✅ tests/vitest.setup.js - Global Vitest setup and memory monitoring
- ✅ scripts/migrate-test-file.js - Automatic Jest to Vitest migration script
- ✅ scripts/track-migration-progress.js - Migration progress tracker
- ✅ scripts/selective-test-runner.js - Cross-framework test runner
- ✅ scripts/run-vitest.js - Optimized Vitest runner
- ✅ scripts/validate-vitest-mocks.js - Mock validation script
- ✅ tests/VITEST_MOCKING_GUIDE.md - Vitest mocking best practices

## Pending Migration (High Priority)
- ⬜ tests/unit/services/researchService.test.js
- ⬜ tests/unit/services/promptManager.test.js
- ⬜ tests/unit/utils/apiClient.test.js
- ⬜ tests/unit/utils/smartCache.test.js

## Code Consolidation Progress
- ✅ Created shared mock factories to eliminate duplicated mock objects
- ✅ Standardized setup/teardown patterns to be consistent across tests
- ✅ Implemented memory usage monitoring to identify leaks
- ✅ Added support for running tests with both Jest and Vitest for comparison

## Known Issues
- ES Module compatibility issues with Jest - expected and handled
- Manual tests for service classes may have different behavior from unit tests due to mocking differences
- Vitest import mocking requires different syntax from Jest - tests should be updated
- Memory pressure during test runs needs better management

## Next Steps
1. Fix Vitest mock implementation issues
2. Continue migrating unit tests (service modules prioritized)
3. Use validation script to confirm test consistency between frameworks
4. Create reusable test fixtures for API responses
5. Convert manual tests to proper test suites where appropriate
6. Improve memory management during test runs

## ESM Compatibility Note
For tests with ES Module compatibility issues in Jest:
1. We prioritize Vitest test results over Jest
2. We consider manual tests and Vitest to be the source of truth
3. We accept Jest failures when they're known to be related to ESM compatibility
