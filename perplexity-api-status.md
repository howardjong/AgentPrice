# Perplexity API Status Report

## Current Status (April 5, 2025)

### Working Models
- ✅ `llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online`: Confirmed working with quick responses

### Not Working / Invalid Models
- ❌ `llama-3.1-sonar-small-online`: Invalid model error
- ❌ `llama-3.1-sonar-small-chat`: Invalid model error  
- ❌ `llama-3.1-sonar-medium-128k-online`: Invalid model error
- ❌ `llama-3.1-sonar-medium-online`: Invalid model error
- ❌ Various older model names (pplx-7b-online, sonar-small-chat, etc.)

### Uncertain Status
- ⚠️ `sonar-deep-research`: Tests time out without clear error or success indication
  - Attempted multiple test scripts with proper timeouts
  - No clear confirmation of request acceptance
  - No successful polling of deep research results

## API Access Details

- **API Endpoint**: https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions
- **Authentication**: API Key provided via environment variable
- **Authentication Status**: Working for at least some models (`llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online`)

## Deep Research Implementation Status

1. **Initial Request**: 
   - Scripts created to properly format and send deep research requests
   - Request properly includes `search_context: 'high'` parameter
   - Requests are being sent but timing out without clear success/failure

2. **Polling Mechanism**: 
   - Robust polling mechanism implemented with backoff retry logic
   - Poll URL extraction from various response formats
   - Storage for poll URLs, intermediate results, and final responses
   - Polling scripts not yet confirmed working due to initial request issues

3. **Results Collection**:
   - Infrastructure for saving and organizing deep research results
   - Tools to extract content, citations, and model info from responses
   - No final results have been confirmed yet due to initial request issues

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **API Key Verification**:
   - Confirm the API key has proper permissions for deep research
   - Consider requesting a new API key specifically for deep research

2. **Alternative Implementation**:
   - Use the working `llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online` model with a modified approach
   - Explore if deep research can be broken into multiple standard requests

3. **Documentation Update**:
   - Review the most current Perplexity API documentation for model changes
   - Confirm the exact name of the deep research model (`sonar-deep-research` vs. alternative name)

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Continue focused testing of individual models rather than batch testing
   - Implement proper logging of all API interactions for debugging

## Conclusion

The Perplexity API is partially working with the `llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online` model, which provides quick responses with citations. However, we have been unable to confirm successful access to the deeper research capability that provides more comprehensive search results with a 30-minute processing time.

We've successfully implemented the infrastructure for handling deep research, including the polling mechanism, request formatting, and results processing. The main blocker appears to be getting the initial deep research request accepted by the API.
