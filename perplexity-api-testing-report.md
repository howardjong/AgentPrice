# Perplexity API Testing Report

## Executive Summary

We've successfully tested and validated the updated Perplexity API integration for the multi-LLM research system. The testing confirms that our code properly handles the new structured response format from Perplexity's API, which now returns data in a consistent `choices` array structure. We've verified both basic query functionality and key components of the deep research workflow.

## Testing Scope

Our testing covered:

1. Basic API connectivity and response handling
2. Processing standard web queries
3. Source/citation extraction from the updated response format
4. Model information extraction
5. Deep research query handling
6. Rate limit compliance (5 requests per minute)
7. Integration with Claude API for the complete research workflow

## Key Findings

1. **API Compatibility**: The updated `perplexityService.js` module correctly processes the new API response format, which now includes a `choices` array containing the message content.

2. **Source Extraction**: The `extractSources` method was successfully modified to handle the new format and can reliably extract citations from both the dedicated `citations` array in the response and parse them from the content text when needed.

3. **Rate Limiting**: We implemented and verified rate limiting to respect Perplexity's constraint of 5 requests per minute, which prevents API timeouts and ensures reliable service.

4. **Deep Research Workflow**: The multi-step deep research workflow (initial query → follow-up questions → follow-up research → synthesis) functions correctly, but requires careful timing due to its extended processing requirements.

5. **Model Information**: Successfully implemented model information extraction to track which model variant is being used for each request.

## Implementation Details

### Updated Response Format Handling

The Perplexity API now returns responses in a more standardized format:

```javascript
{
  "id": "5668f9b0-9716-4c56-937a-34ddefadbd19",
  "model": "sonar",
  "created": 1743867250,
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 12,
    "completion_tokens": 245,
    "total_tokens": 257
  },
  "citations": [
    "https://stripe.com/en-pl/resources/more/saas-pricing-models-101",
    // Additional citations...
  ],
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "When developing a SaaS pricing strategy..."
      },
      "delta": {
        "role": "assistant", 
        "content": ""
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Our code now extracts content from the `choices[0].message.content` path while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Rate Limiting Implementation

To respect Perplexity's rate limits:

```javascript
const REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 5;
const MINUTE_IN_MS = 60 * 1000;
const DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS = Math.ceil(MINUTE_IN_MS / REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE);

// Adding delay between requests
await delay(DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS);
```

## Test Cases

1. **Simple Query Test**: Validated basic query handling with the updated API format
2. **Deep Research Steps Test**: Verified each step of the deep research workflow individually
3. **Direct API Test**: Confirmed raw API interaction without using intermediate service layers
4. **Model Extraction Test**: Verified that model information is correctly extracted from responses
5. **Integrated Workflow Test**: Validated the end-to-end research workflow with Claude and Perplexity

## Recommendations

1. **Response Format Standardization**: Consider standardizing all Perplexity service responses to a consistent format that maintains compatibility with both legacy and new API versions.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for specific API error codes, particularly for rate limit (429) errors.

3. **Automated Retries**: Implement automatic retries with exponential backoff for transient failures.

4. **Workflow Status Tracking**: Enhance the deep research workflow with better status tracking and intermediate result storage.

5. **Rate Limit Optimization**: Consider implementing a more sophisticated rate limiting system that pools requests across instances for higher throughput.

## Conclusion

The modified Perplexity service implementation successfully adapts to the updated API response format while maintaining backward compatibility. The testing confirms that all key functionality works as expected, including the critical deep research capabilities. With the recommended enhancements, the system will be more robust and maintainable for future API updates.
