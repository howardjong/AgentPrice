/**
 * Post-Merge Monitoring Plan
 * =========================
 *
 * Date: April 4, 2025
 * Version: 1.0
 * Status: Active
 *
 * Purpose
 * -------
 *
 * This document outlines the monitoring approach for the 48-hour period following the Jest to 
 * Vitest migration and Socket.IO optimizations merge. The goal is to ensure system stability 
 * and identify any potential regression issues early.
 *
 * Monitoring Metrics
 * -----------------
 *
 * 1. System Performance Metrics
 *
 * | Metric | Target | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold |
 * |--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
 * | CPU Usage | <30% | >50% | >70% |
 * | Memory Usage | <70% | >80% | >90% |
 * | Response Time | <200ms | >500ms | >1000ms |
 * | Error Rate | <0.5% | >1% | >3% |
 * | Socket Reconnections | <5/hour | >10/hour | >20/hour |
 *
 * 2. Test Coverage Metrics
 *
 * | Module | Statement | Branch | Function | Line |
 * |--------|-----------|--------|----------|------|
 * | SearchUtils | >86% | >86% | 100% | >85% |
 * | PerformanceMonitor | >93% | >91% | >94% | >92% |
 * | Basic Socket.IO | >82% | >80% | >85% | >80% |
 *
 * Any decrease below these established post-merge values should be investigated.
 *
 * Monitoring Schedule
 * ------------------
 *
 * | Timeframe | Action | Responsible |
 * |-----------|--------|-------------|
 * | Hour 0 | Run full validation suite, establish baseline | Testing Team |
 * | Hours 1-4 | Monitor system logs every 30 minutes | On-call Engineer |
 * | Hours 5-12 | Monitor system logs every hour | On-call Engineer |
 * | Hours 13-24 | Monitor system logs every 2 hours | On-call Engineer |
 * | Hours 25-48 | Monitor system logs every 4 hours | On-call Engineer |
 * | Hour 48 | Run full validation suite, compare with baseline | Testing Team |
 *
 * Health Check Procedures
 * ----------------------
 *
 * 1. Socket.IO Health Check
 *
 * Run the Socket.IO health check utility every 4 hours:
 *
 * ```bash
 * node tests/unit/websocket/socket-io-health-check.js
 * ```
 *
 * Expected output should include "Socket.IO Health Check: PASSED" and 0 errors.
 *
 * 2. Database Connection Health Check
 *
 * Run the database connection test every 4 hours:
 *
 * ```bash
 * npx vitest run tests/unit/database/connection-test.vitest.js
 * ```
 *
 * All tests should pass with 0 failures.
 *
 * 3. End-to-End Query Flow Test
 *
 * Run the end-to-end query test every 8 hours:
 *
 * ```bash
 * node tests/e2e/single-query-flow-test.js
 * ```
 *
 * Expected response should include successful execution with 0 errors.
 *
 * Automated Monitoring
 * -------------------
 *
 * The automated monitoring script at `scripts/run-48h-monitoring.sh` will run these
 * health checks on the defined schedule and log results to the monitoring report.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * ```bash
 * chmod +x scripts/run-48h-monitoring.sh
 * ./scripts/run-48h-monitoring.sh
 * ```
 *
 * Alerting Criteria
 * ----------------
 *
 * - Warning Alert: Notify the development team if any metric crosses the warning threshold.
 * - Critical Alert: Page the on-call engineer and notify the technical lead if any metric crosses the critical threshold.
 * - Test Failure Alert: Notify the testing team and development team if any automated test fails during the monitoring period.
 *
 * Rollback Procedure
 * -----------------
 *
 * If critical issues are identified during the monitoring period:
 *
 * 1. Page the on-call engineer and technical lead immediately
 * 2. Convene an emergency assessment call within 30 minutes
 * 3. If issues cannot be resolved within 2 hours, initiate rollback:
 *    ```bash
 *    git revert [merge-commit-hash]
 *    npm run db:revert
 *    npm run test:verify
 *    ```
 * 4. Notify all stakeholders of the rollback
 * 5. Schedule a post-mortem analysis for the next business day
 *
 * Sign-off Criteria
 * ----------------
 *
 * The monitoring period will be considered successful if:
 *
 * 1. No critical alerts are triggered
 * 2. No more than 3 warning alerts are triggered (and all are resolved)
 * 3. All automated tests continue to pass
 * 4. No regression in API response times is observed
 * 5. No customer-reported issues related to the changes
 *
 * Documentation Updates
 * -------------------
 *
 * At the conclusion of the monitoring period, this document should be updated with:
 *
 * 1. A summary of any issues encountered
 * 2. Resolution steps taken
 * 3. Recommendations for future migrations
 * 4. Final sign-off from the technical lead
 *
