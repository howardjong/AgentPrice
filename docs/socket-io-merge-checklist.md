# Socket.IO Optimizations Merge Checklist

## Pre-Merge Validation

- [x] Created Socket.IO test optimizations utility module
- [x] Created example optimized reconnection test
- [x] Verified test runs successfully in Replit environment
- [x] Created documentation for the optimizations
- [x] Added commit notes for the Socket.IO optimizations
- [x] Created health check utility for Socket.IO tests
- [ ] Run all existing Socket.IO tests with the new optimizations
- [ ] Run the health check before merge

## Health Check Process

1. Execute `node tests/unit/websocket/socket-io-health-check.js` to validate the Socket.IO environment
2. Review the health check report for any issues
3. Address any warnings or errors before proceeding with the merge
4. Verify optimization settings match Replit environment requirements

## Merge Process

1. Ensure all tests pass with the new optimizations
2. Include the Socket.IO optimizations commit note in the merge commit message
3. Merge during low-traffic period
4. After merge, verify WebSocket functionality in the production environment

## Post-Merge Tasks

1. Update all existing Socket.IO tests to use the optimizations
2. Review any timeouts in other Socket.IO tests
3. Verify reconnection functionality works in all environments
4. Update the developer documentation with these best practices

## Known Limitations

- Socket.IO tests should be run individually or in small batches
- Tests using these utilities still need `DEBUG=socket.io*` for full debugging
- Maximum recommended timeout is 10 seconds for any Socket.IO operation in Replit
