# Performance Optimization Plan

This document outlines our strategy for improving system performance and reducing resource consumption.

## Current Performance Analysis

We've implemented monitoring tools to help identify the most resource-intensive components and operations. The primary areas of concern are:

1. API client overhead and connection management
2. Eager loading of dependencies
3. Lack of resource usage monitoring
4. Long-running operations without timeout management
5. Inefficient request handling and retries

## Optimization Priorities

### 1. Implement Monitoring and Telemetry

- [x] Created performance monitoring utility
- [x] Added dashboard for system performance metrics
- [x] Add detailed API call tracking
- [x] Implement endpoint-specific performance analysis

### 2. Reduce Resource Consumption

- [x] Implemented lazy loading for API service dependencies
- [x] Optimized API client to reduce resource usage
- [x] Implement memory leak detection and prevention
- [x] Optimize promise handling and cleanup

### 3. Improve Response Times

- [x] Implement smarter caching strategies
- [x] Optimize prompt templates for token efficiency
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary API calls
- [x] Improve circuit breaker patterns

### 4. Optimize Specific Services

#### PerplexityService
- [x] Implement lazy loading
- [x] Add performance tracking
- [ ] Optimize request patterns for better token usage
- [ ] Implement smart fallbacks for rate limiting

#### Research Service
- [ ] Implement tiered response strategy
- [ ] Add response caching
- [ ] Optimize for token usage

## Performance Testing

Use the system performance dashboard to gather baseline metrics, then measure improvements after implementing each optimization.

Run:
```
node tests/manual/systemPerformanceDashboard.js
```

## Next Steps

1. Run the system performance dashboard to identify bottlenecks
2. Implement prioritized optimizations
3. Measure impact of changes
4. Document improvement metrics
