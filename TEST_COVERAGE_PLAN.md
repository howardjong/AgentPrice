# Test Coverage Plan

This document outlines the approach to achieve and maintain comprehensive test coverage across the Multi-LLM Research System. The goal is to ensure at least 80% coverage for branches, functions, lines, and statements.

## Coverage Requirements

| Metric     | Target | Current | Status |
|------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Branches   | 80%    | TBD     | TBD    |
| Functions  | 80%    | TBD     | TBD    |
| Lines      | 80%    | TBD     | TBD    |
| Statements | 80%    | TBD     | TBD    |

## Priority Areas for Testing

### 1. Service Modules

All service modules should have corresponding test files that verify:
- Core functionality
- Error handling
- Integration with other services
- Boundary conditions
- Performance constraints

Priority services:
- Claude service (`server/services/claude.ts`)
- Perplexity service (`server/services/perplexity.ts`)
- Router service (`server/services/router.ts`)
- Health check service (`server/services/healthCheck.ts`)
- Diagnostic service (`server/services/diagnostic.ts`)
- Redis service (`services/redisService.js`)
- Context manager (`services/contextManager.js`)
- Prompt manager (`services/promptManager.js`)
- Job manager (`services/jobManager.js`)
- Research service (`services/researchService.js`)

### 2. API Endpoints/Controllers

All API endpoints should have comprehensive tests that verify:
- Request validation
- Response formatting
- Error handling
- Authentication (where applicable)
- Rate limiting (where applicable)
- Proper storage interactions

Priority endpoints:
- Chat/Conversation endpoint
- Research endpoint
- Visualization endpoint
- Health endpoint
- Status endpoint
- Deep research endpoint
- File analysis endpoint

### 3. Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling tests should verify:
- Invalid input handling
- Service failure recovery
- Circuit breaker behavior
- Rate limit handling
- Network error recovery
- Timeout handling
- Error propagation

### 4. End-to-End Workflows

Complete workflow tests should verify:
- Chat workflow
- Research workflow
- Chart generation workflow
- Deep research workflow
- File analysis workflow

### 5. WebSocket/Socket.IO Functionality

Test socket-based communication:
- Connection establishment
- Event broadcasting
- Client reconnection
- Error handling
- Distributed event propagation

## Test Implementation Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests

- Use appropriate mocking to isolate components
- Test each function with multiple input scenarios
- Verify both success and failure paths
- Test boundary conditions and edge cases

### 2. Integration Tests

- Test interactions between multiple components
- Use controlled test environments
- Verify data flow through multiple services
- Test service-to-service communication

### 3. API Tests

- Test each API endpoint with valid and invalid requests
- Verify correct status codes and response formats
- Test with and without authentication
- Test rate limiting behavior

### 4. Workflow Tests

- Test complete business processes
- Verify proper state transitions
- Test long-running operations
- Verify resource cleanup

### 5. Mock Strategies

- Use controlled Redis mock for caching tests
- Use Nock for external API mocks
- Use Socket.IO mocks for WebSocket testing
- Use file system mocks for file I/O tests

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Service Module Tests
1. Verify all services have corresponding test files
2. Ensure basic functionality is tested
3. Add error handling tests
4. Add integration tests

### Phase 2: API Endpoint Tests
1. Test all endpoints with basic functionality tests
2. Add input validation tests
3. Add error handling tests
4. Test authentication and authorization

### Phase 3: End-to-End Workflow Tests
1. Implement tests for complete workflows
2. Test long-running processes
3. Test error recovery in workflows
4. Test resource cleanup

### Phase 4: Performance and Edge Case Tests
1. Test system under load
2. Test resource-intensive operations
3. Test boundary conditions
4. Test timeout and recovery behavior

## Tools

- **Run Coverage Check**: `node scripts/run-coverage.js`
- **Coverage Reports**: Located in `./reports/coverage/`
- **Test Documentation**: Update this document with current coverage data

## Measuring Success

Success will be measured by:
1. Achieving 80%+ coverage in all metrics
2. All services having corresponding test files
3. All API endpoints having comprehensive tests
4. Robust error handling tests in place
5. End-to-end workflow tests verifying complete functionality

## Next Steps

1. Run the coverage script to establish current baseline
2. Identify gaps in test coverage
3. Prioritize missing tests based on critical functionality
4. Implement missing tests
5. Re-run coverage checks to validate improvements
